# RFD 1056 details: roles, log fields, ownership, and the sync commands

## Machines and roles

| Role | Hardware | Typical access | Client IP in `remote-log` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dev workstation | Windows Surface Laptop Studio 2 | Local editor, Chrome/Edge, `npm run dev`, webcam tests | `10.0.0.32` (example LAN IP, where Vite binds on the Surface) |
| Remote Linux | NVIDIA DGX Spark | Mostly headless; NVIDIA Sync (Tailscale) for SSH/remote editing as user `sifr`; occasional HDMI monitor | Not the browser that posts most `webcamDebug` or desktop `remote-log` lines |
| XR headset | Galaxy XR (Chrome WebXR) | Opens `https://<dev-workstation-LAN-IP>:3000/...` on the LAN | `10.0.0.224` (example) |

Do not conflate the DGX Spark with "the PC" when reading a log. The
Surface runs the Vite dev server and most desktop browser sessions;
the DGX is for remote compute and SSH, unless a browser is opened on
it explicitly.

## Network flow, development

```
[Surface]  npm run dev  ->  https://<Surface-LAN-IP>:3000/
    ^ POST /__remote_log, /__native_face_ingest
    |
[Galaxy XR Chrome]  ?nativeFaceRelay=1&remoteLog=1  (AR/VR, relay, playback)
    ^ POST face JSON from a native face-relay app (same-origin ingest on the Surface)

[DGX Spark]  SSH / API / builds, via NVIDIA Sync -- not required for headset -> Surface LAN URL
```

- Headset `localhost`: `https://localhost:3000` on the headset targets the headset itself, not the Surface. Always use the Surface's own LAN IP in a headset URL.
- `3DAIGC-API` may run on the DGX or another host (`VITE_API_ENDPOINT`), a separate concern from where Vite serves the web app.
- The NVIDIA XR AI stack runs on the DGX only (`/home/sifr/xr-ai`); RFD 105f gives its own Media Hub access path.

## Reading `logs/remote-log.txt`

Each line includes the HTTP client that forwarded it:

```
[REMOTE_LOG][::ffff:10.0.0.224][session=…][info] … (https://10.0.0.32:3000/?…)
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[::ffff:10.0.0.224]` | Who sent the log (for example, Galaxy XR Chrome) |
| `(https://10.0.0.32:3000/…)` | The dev-server origin the tab loaded from (Surface Vite) |
| The query string on that URL | Which test mode was active (`nativeFaceRelay`, `nativeFacePlayback`, `webcamDebug`, `xrDebugInputs`, and so on) |

Vite rotates the log at roughly 5 MB, to
`logs/remote-log.<timestamp>.txt`; older XR and relay history often
lives in an archive, not the current file.

### Query flags, by typical device

| Flag | Usually exercised on |
| --- | --- |
| `webcamDebug=1` | The Surface browser (`10.0.0.32`) |
| `nativeFaceRelay=1` | The headset's Chrome (`10.0.0.224`); ingest handled by the Surface's Vite |
| `nativeFacePlayback=…` | The headset, and sometimes the Surface, for AR replay |
| `xrDebugInputs=1` | The headset, during a WebXR session |

## DGX Spark access

NVIDIA Sync is the primary way to reach the headless Spark; HDMI
gives an optional local console, and does not change the log roles
above unless a browser runs there directly. SSH has two hosts only:
`DGX-Local` (LAN, `10.0.0.158`) and `DGX-Remote` (Tailscale, through
NVIDIA Sync), both as user `sifr`. RFD 1065 gives the full naming
rule.

## Two editor entry points, one repository

| Workspace | Typical path | Editor connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Surface (local dev, Galaxy XR) | `C:\Users\alfao\Documents\GitHub\Weftspun3DStudio` | Local folder |
| DGX Spark (SSH agent) | `/home/sifr/Weftspun3DStudio` | `DGX-Local` or `DGX-Remote` |

| Role | Machine | Typical commands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web UI, WebXR, headset tests | Surface | `npm run dev`, serving `https://<Surface-LAN-IP>:3000/` |
| `3DAIGC-API` inference | DGX Spark (`:7842`) | Via `VITE_API_ENDPOINT` or the dev proxy |
| Code edits | Surface | Pushed to DGX with `sync-changes-to-dgx.ps1` (preferred) or the full `sync-to-dgx.ps1` |

Avoiding a mixed-content block, HTTPS dev on the Surface plus Galaxy XR:

```env
DEV_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://10.0.0.158:7842
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=/__dev_dgx_proxy
```

Vite forwards `https://<Surface>:3000/__dev_dgx_proxy/...` to the
DGX API. In a DGX SSH session, `VITE_API_ENDPOINT` can point at
`http://127.0.0.1:7842` when the API runs locally there.

Auto-rigging (aligned with this project's own upstream): a viewport
mesh upload plus a JSON `generate-rig` call.
`src/library/taskManager.js`'s `executeAutoRigging` calls `POST
/api/v1/file-upload/mesh`, then `POST
/api/v1/auto-rigging/generate-rig`. `src/components/TaskAdvancedOptions.jsx`
sets rig mode, skin weights, and output format (FBX or GLB).
`src/library/aiModelsCatalog.js` names `unirig_auto_rig` and
`skintokens_auto_rig`. Only `unirig_auto_rig` is enabled on the API
today, unless `skintokens_auto_rig` is added to `config/models.yaml`
on the DGX backend.

## Sync without GitHub

No cloud repository is required. Changed files copy over LAN or
Tailscale only, `scp`-based, last write wins:

| Route | SSH host | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same Wi-Fi | `DGX-Local` | The Spark at `10.0.0.158` |
| Away from the LAN | `DGX-Remote` | NVIDIA Sync plus Tailscale |

## Surface/DGX sync cheat sheet

The problem: both machines hold a copy of this repository. If both
edit `src/` at the same time, one side's work can be silently
overwritten by the other's `scp` push.

The golden rule: one machine owns `src/` at a time.

| Situation | `src/` owner | What to run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal development plus Galaxy XR, on the Surface | Surface | Push after edits (below); the DGX never uses `--include-src`. |
| Explicitly coding on DGX Remote | DGX | Lock, edit, `sync-changes-to-pc.sh --include-src --retry-until-complete`, then release the lock. The Surface does not push until that finishes. |

### Quick commands, Surface (PowerShell, repository root)

```powershell
# After edits (preferred, git-changed Surface-owned files only)
.\scripts\sync-changes-to-dgx.ps1 -RetryUntilComplete

# Full resync (first clone, or large drift)
.\scripts\sync-to-dgx.ps1 -RetryUntilComplete

# Pull DGX-owned files only (README, Pitch Deck, package.json, branding docs)
.\scripts\sync-from-dgx.ps1

# Away from the home LAN
.\scripts\sync-changes-to-dgx.ps1 -Remote -RetryUntilComplete
```

Never pipe sync output through `Select-Object -First`; it can stall
`scp`.

### Quick commands, DGX (bash, repository root)

```bash
# After DGX-owned edits (preferred)
bash scripts/sync-changes-to-pc.sh --retry-until-complete

# Full DGX-owned push
bash scripts/sync-to-pc.sh

# Before editing src/ on DGX
bash scripts/sync-lock-utils.sh lock "reason"

# After editing src/ on DGX, push changed src/ only
bash scripts/sync-changes-to-pc.sh --include-src --retry-until-complete
bash scripts/sync-lock-utils.sh unlock
```

### If sync aborts on `.sync-lock-dgx`

The DGX is mid-edit on `src/`. Stop. Wait for the DGX side to finish
and release the lock, or confirm with the team which machine is
canonical before using `-Force`.

### When both sides changed something

```powershell
.\scripts\sync-from-dgx.ps1          # 1) DGX docs/branding -> Surface, never src/
# 2) Resolve any src/ conflict by hand; never blind-push
.\scripts\sync-changes-to-dgx.ps1 -RetryUntilComplete   # 3) only if the Surface's src/ is the truth
```

### Backup

Sync scripts live in this repository's own `scripts/` directory.
Git commits on the Surface are the real rollback; no separate copy
of the sync scripts is needed.

## Who owns what

| File or folder | Source of truth | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MONETIZATION_ROADMAP.md` | Surface | PC to DGX only, never pulled back |
| `src/`, this project's own `scripts/` (not `sync-*.ps1`) | Surface | PC to DGX only |
| `Pitch Deck/`, `README.md`, `package.json`, branding doc pages | DGX (edited there) | DGX to PC only |
| `vite.config.js`, `index.html`, `public/`, `.env` | Surface (runs `npm run dev`) | Manual, stays on the PC |

One canonical roadmap file only: `MONETIZATION_ROADMAP.md`. No
`MONETIZATION_ROADMAP_BACKUP.md`, no dated variants, no HTML export,
on the DGX; `bash scripts/prune-sync-duplicates.sh` runs after every
PC push.

From the Surface repository root (PowerShell), when both sides
changed something:

```powershell
# 1) Pull DGX doc/branding and sync-workflow scripts (never src or roadmaps)
.\scripts\sync-from-dgx.ps1

# 2) Push PC code and MONETIZATION_ROADMAP.md to DGX (auto-runs the DGX-side ensure step)
#    Prefer incremental: .\scripts\sync-to-dgx.ps1 -Paths src/library
.\scripts\sync-to-dgx.ps1
```

```powershell
# Away from the home LAN
.\scripts\sync-to-dgx.ps1 -Remote
.\scripts\sync-from-dgx.ps1 -Remote

# A single wrapper for either direction
.\scripts\sync-dgx.ps1 -Direction to-dgx -Paths src/library
.\scripts\sync-dgx.ps1 -Direction from-dgx
```

On the DGX (optional; `sync-to-dgx.ps1` runs this automatically
after each PC push):

```bash
cd /home/sifr/Weftspun3DStudio
bash scripts/ensure-dgx-sync-ready.sh
```

Or push DGX-owned files to the Surface, when Surface SSH is enabled:

```bash
bash scripts/sync-to-pc.sh
```

Every sync uses `scp` and `ssh` only.

**What syncs, PC to DGX:** `src/*`, this project's own `scripts/*`
(excluding `sync-*.ps1`, `prune-sync-duplicates.sh`,
`sync-to-pc.sh`, `ensure-dgx-sync-ready.sh`), and
`MONETIZATION_ROADMAP.md`.

**What syncs, DGX to PC:** `Pitch Deck/`, `README.md`,
`package.json`, branding doc pages, plus the sync-workflow scripts
themselves (`sync-*.ps1`, `prune-sync-duplicates.sh`) when those
change on the DGX.

**What never syncs DGX to PC:** `src/`, the rest of `scripts/`,
`MONETIZATION_ROADMAP.md`.

`-IncludeDocs`, on `to-dgx` only, also mirrors the full `docs/` tree
from the PC; use it only after a broad PC-side docs edit, then run
`prune-sync-duplicates.sh` on the DGX.

**What sync never copies at all:** `vite.config.js`, `index.html`,
`public/`, `.env`. Those stay on whichever machine runs `npm run
dev`, usually the Surface.

Browsing `https://10.0.0.32:3000` is the Surface's own `npm run dev`
session; pushing files to the DGX does not change that browser
session. DGX sync exists for the DGX-side remote editing agent and
for sharing docs with the `3DAIGC-API` codebase, not for updating
the Surface's own dev server.

Avatar rig GLBs come from the `3DAIGC-API` export on the DGX
(UniRig, then a Blender GLB step). Copying this project's docs to
the DGX does not fix a broken rig; the API itself must implement RFD
0083's contract. Re-opening an old, completed task still downloads
the same GLB; a new avatar-from-image job is needed after an API
fix.
