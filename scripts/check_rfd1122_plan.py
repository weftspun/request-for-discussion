"""Check `rfd1122-plan.usda` against RFD 1122, and against itself.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A plan written as prose can say step 8 depends on step 9 and nobody
notices. A plan written as a graph can too, unless something reads the graph. This reads
it: every `dependsOn` target must resolve, must have a strictly lower `order`, and the
`order` values must be 1..N with no gaps and no repeats. It found one defect while being
written -- the renderer sat at order 2 depending on the bake at order 3.

AND AGAINST THE DOCUMENT. Every count under /Rfd1122/Quantities is searched for in the
source documents with commas stripped, as a whole token. The stage is not allowed to be the
only place a number lives, because then the number is unreviewed and the RFD and the plan
can drift apart silently. This is the pattern `check-rfd-structure.py` uses for RFD 1000's
state list: read the claim out of the document rather than restating it.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK. Whether the plan is a good plan, and whether the counts are right
-- only that the two artefacts agree. A wrong number stated identically in both passes.

Usage:
    python check_rfd1122_plan.py [stage.usda] [--self-test]

Exit code is non-zero on any failure, and on any negative control that fails to fail.
