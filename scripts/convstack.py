"""The synthetic graph both accelerator benches measure, and its operation count.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. `ane_bench.py` measures Core ML and imports coremltools at the
top; `litert_bench.py` measures LiteRT and cannot import that environment. Copying the graph
into the second bench would make two definitions of one thing, and the figures would compose
only for as long as nobody edited one of them. A shared import cannot drift.
