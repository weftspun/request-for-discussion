# Gate: the aphoristic negative definition, ratcheted toward how people actually write.
#
# THE TROPE. "A number nobody waited for isn't a measurement." "An ignore is not a lock."
# A short sentence, generic subject, predicate a negation, landing as a maxim. tropes.fyi
# catalogues its neighbours -- negative parallelism ("It's not X, it's Y") and quotable
# one-liners -- and stops short of this form, so the gate names it.
#
# CALIBRATED AGAINST THE COMMONS RATHER THAN AGAINST OURSELVES. A first version took its
# ceiling from the p90 of this repository's own files, which bakes the habit in: a document may
# be as aphoristic as its neighbours, and its neighbours are us. Measured instead against
# public-domain works chosen for reading MORE easily than technical writing:
#
#     Alice in Wonderland        0.15 per 1000 words    Flesch 81.3    27,427 words
#     Wizard of Oz               0.28                   Flesch 80.0    40,000
#     Aesop's Fables             0.31                   Flesch 68.0    45,078

# Eight times the commons rate, in prose measurably harder to read. Public domain rather than
# CC-BY-SA, because share-alike is blocklisted here. Gutenberg ids 11, 55, 21, 74 and 16,
# fetched 2026-08-23 and recorded here rather than re-fetched: a gate needing the network fails
# for reasons unrelated to the file under test.
#
# GENRE EXPLAINS PART OF THE GAP. Strunk's Elements of Style, prescriptive writing guidance
# like ours, scores 1.01 per 1000 at Flesch 58.7 -- three times the narrative rate. Some of our
# density comes from the genre. Three times the commons rate is 0.90 against our 2.69, which
# leaves most of the gap to the habit.
#
# NOT OBTAINED, named rather than dropped: pre-2020 US government plain-language guidance, which
# is public domain and written to be read. plainlanguage.gov serves guidelines whose text
# extracts to 413 words, and the 2011 PDF URL returns HTML.
#
# THE RULE IS A RATCHET, so the tree walks down instead of being condemned:
#
#     above the commons rate      may not rise; it holds or falls
#     at or under it              may not cross
#     a file that is new          must land at or under the commons rate
#
# WHY ELIXIR. The other gate in this workspace is `Mix.Tasks.CheckSkipTags`, and this follows
# its shape -- documented switches, an exit code, controls that must fail. A standalone script
# rather than a Mix task because this repository is prose and has no mix project; `elixir
# scripts/check_prose_tropes.exs` needs nothing built.
#
# EQUIVALENCE WITH THE PYTHON IT REPLACES WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. Both were run over
# the same six files and agreed to two decimals every time: 2.66, 0.90, 0.00, 2.23, 0.83, 0.82,
# with identical control output. `--rate <file>` prints one file's figure, which is how that
# comparison was made and how the next one can be. The Python is deleted, so the rule has one
# home.
#
# Usage:
#     elixir scripts/check_prose_tropes.exs [<repo>] [--base <ref>]
#     elixir scripts/check_prose_tropes.exs --self-test
#     elixir scripts/check_prose_tropes.exs --rate <file>
#
# Exit codes: 0 within the ratchet, 1 a file rose or crossed, 2 bad usage.
