"""Gate: a document carries no index of the files beside it.

A hand-written index of a directory is a second copy of `ls`, and the two
disagree the first time somebody adds a file and forgets the table. Nothing
reports that. The rows were accurate the afternoon they were written, which
is exactly what turns a stale index into a confident, wrong answer about
what is here.

## What counts as an index row

A table row or a list item whose FIRST cell names a file or a directory,
in backticks or as a link:

    | `todo.md`  | the running logbook |
    - [todo.md](todo.md) - the running logbook

Prose that names a file is fine, and so is a table whose subject is
something other than the file tree: a measurement table with a filename
in a later column stays legal.

Whether the file exists is not the test. A row pointing at a present file
is an index that will rot; a row pointing at a missing one has rotted
already. Both fail for the same reason, so existence is never consulted.

## Rewritten twice, and both reasons are worth keeping

First, it parsed by hand — `line.strip().startswith("|")`, a regex to
split cells, another to find list markers — while `check-rfd-structure.py`
next door already parsed markdown with markdown-it. A gate that reasons
about table structure should use the parser rather than approximate it,
and this one now walks the CommonMark token stream: rows come from
`tr_open`, cells from `th_open`/`td_open`, and a first cell is a file
reference only when its inline content is a single code span or link.

Second, and this is the one that caused a false accusation: the old
pattern was `^[\\w.\\-/]+(\\.\\w+|/)$`, which reads any dotted token as
a filename. It flagged `foot.R`, an ANNY bone in a residual table, as an
index row — and the author rewrote a perfectly good table into prose to
satisfy it rather than fixing the gate. A dot is not an extension. The
extension must be one this workspace actually uses, or the name must
carry a path separator.

Third, a slash was treated as sufficient evidence of a path, so
`head/neck` — a body region in a residual table — was read as a
two-segment filename. That is the `foot.R` mistake with a different
separator. A path now has to start at a side, the digit-prefixed
top-level directories, or carry a known extension, or end in a separator.

## Detection floor

An index row naming a file whose extension is absent from the list below
reads as legal. That is a miss rather than a false alarm, and the fix is
to add the extension when a new kind of file arrives, which is a visible
edit rather than a silent drift.
