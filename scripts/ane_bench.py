"""What the Apple Neural Engine can address, and what precision buys once it can.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `rfd1122-plan.usda`'s M2Pro scope ends in two booleans:

    custom bool neuralEngineReachableViaOnnx = 1
    custom bool neuralEngineUsefulForBackbone = 0

The second is backed by 1685.1 ms at 576 against the CPU's 476.4, measured through ONNX
Runtime's CoreML execution provider. That provider PARTITIONS a graph and falls back
per operator, and the run recorded no placement. So the number cannot distinguish "ran
on the Neural Engine and was slow" from "never reached the Neural Engine at all", and
those have opposite consequences. This script measures placement first and refuses to
report a latency without it.

THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS FIRST, AND WHY PRECISION COMES SECOND. If the device can address
the whole 32 GiB of unified memory, then four bits against eight against sixteen is not
a fitting problem and there is nothing to trade -- the part computes in fp16 either way,
so fp16 is both what fits and the native width. Precision becomes a lever only if the
ceiling binds below what we deploy. `--ceiling` therefore runs before `--ladder`, at
fp16 AND at int4, because WHERE the two sweeps stop is what says which kind of limit it
is: the same parameter count means an address-space or graph limit that precision cannot
move, and int4 reaching further means a byte limit that it can.

METHOD FOR PLACEMENT. `MLComputePlan` reports, per operation, which device Core ML
prefers. Constants carry no device and are excluded from the denominator -- counting
them would let a graph of mostly weights look well-placed no matter where the arithmetic
went. The fraction reported is over real operations only, and the const count is printed
beside it rather than hidden.

METHOD FOR TIMING. Best-of and median over repetitions, after a warm-up that is
discarded, because the first prediction pays for lazy compilation and weight staging.
A coefficient of variation accompanies every median: on a fanless-adjacent part a tight
median with a wide spread is a thermal story, not a throughput one.

WHAT A NUMBER HERE DOES NOT MEAN. A synthetic convolution stack is a friendly shape.
It is an upper bound on what a real graph reaches, in the same way `gpu_tops.py`'s dense
GEMM is an upper bound for that device, and it should be read as one.

THE NEGATIVE CONTROL SHIPS WITH THE GATE. `--selftest` asserts that the detector reports
ZERO Neural Engine operations for a configuration known not to use it. A placement gate
that has never returned "no" certifies nothing, which is the defect this script exists
to correct in the first place.

    The mechanism behind the ceiling answer. If a 4-bit package expands to fp16 at

    move a ceiling expressed in bytes.

    THE CAVEAT IS PART OF THE RESULT: process RSS need not include weights staged into
    an ANE-managed allocation, so a flat RSS falls short of proving nothing widened. The
    on-disk column and the RSS column are both reported and neither is called the
