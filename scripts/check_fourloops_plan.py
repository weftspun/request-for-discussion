"""Check `fourloops-plan.usda` against its sources, against the chart, and against itself.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three documents describe the same four loops: the stage, the chart beside
it (`fourloops-etnf.usda`), and the code the two are about. Nothing stops them drifting
apart except something that reads all three, so this reads all three.

WHAT IT CHECKS, and why each is separate.

1. ORDER. Task `order` values are 1..N with no gaps and no repeats, and every `needs`
   target has a strictly lower order than the task that needs it. A plan written as a graph
   can still say step 3 depends on step 5; only reading the graph catches it.

2. TARGETS RESOLVE. Every relationship target is a prim path that exists in the layer. A
   typo in a `</FourLoops/Stages/...>` path composes without complaint and means nothing.

3. COUNTS ARE NOT ONLY HERE. Every integer under `/FourLoops/Quantities` is searched for in
   the sources the layer names, as a whole token with commas stripped. A number that lives
   only in the stage is a number nobody reviewed. This is the pattern
   `check-rfd-structure.py` uses for RFD 1000's state list and `check_rfd1122_plan.py` uses
   for RFD 1122's.

4. THE CHART AGREES, IN ONE DIRECTION. Every stage the plan declares must be mentioned in
   the chart. The reverse check existed while the chart was HTML and was deleted when it
   became a layer: see the note beside CODE_RE. A stage nobody described is the drift that
   remains possible.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK. Whether the plan is a good plan, and whether the counts are right.
Only that the artefacts agree. A wrong number stated identically in both passes, which is
why the sources are read rather than the stage trusted.

    python check_fourloops_plan.py [stage.usda] [--self-test]

Exit code is non-zero on any failure, and on any negative control that fails to fail.
