"""Check that every RFD number follows the org-qualified decimal rule.

RFD 1000 gives the rule. This script enforces it. Run --self-test to see each
check reject a known-bad input, because a check that passes on broken input
certifies the defect instead of catching it.

This gate owns numbering: directory names, the organization digit, serial
uniqueness, and heading agreement. It used to also check ALIASES.md coverage,
and that table is deleted rather than extended, so the check went with it. RFD
1000 records what the deletion costs. It used to also scan
for unmigrated decimal citations, and no longer does. That scan read the raw
bytes, so a citation an RFD wrapped over two lines never matched it: it found
3 of the 37 in the tree. `check-rfd-structure.py` reads the same citations off
a CommonMark AST and finds all of them, so the scan moved there rather than
being kept in two places at two strengths. RFD 1124 records the move.
