"""Check `pen-66606.usda`, the composed view of every serial the PEN has issued.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A serial is the last arc of an OID under PEN 66606, so it names one
document for as long as the arc exists. Each manual site keeps its own register and
authors only its own serials. This layer sublayers those registers into one stage. It
stores no serial itself, because a register duplicated across sites is not a record: the
first copy edited would win by accident and nothing would report the other.

The composition is what makes that arrangement safe and also what makes it silent when it
breaks. USD composes a sublayer that resolves and says nothing about one that does not,
the same way it says nothing about a relationship whose target is missing. Two sites
authoring the same serial compose into one prim with one value, which reads exactly like
agreement. Neither `usdchecker` nor `check_usd_valid.py` has an opinion about either.

WHAT IT CHECKS.

1. EVERY SUBLAYER RESOLVES. A path that does not resolve composes to nothing, and a
   register that contributes nothing looks identical to a site with no serials.

2. A SITE AUTHORS ONLY ITS OWN SERIALS. Site 1's serials begin with 1. A site that
   authored 2015 would be allocating in another site's space, which is the collision RFD
   1000 was written for: before it, 113 numbers named a document in two repositories.

3. NO TWO SITES AUTHOR THE SAME SERIAL. Checked against the layer stack rather than the
   composed stage, because composition is exactly what hides this. Two sites authoring
   serial 1015 compose to one row.

4. EVERY SITE IS ACCOUNTED FOR. A site named in `sites` either contributes a sublayer or
   carries a row in `sitesWithoutRegister` saying why it does not. A site that quietly
   left the composition would otherwise read as a site with nothing to declare.

5. COLUMN ARRAYS ARE PARALLEL. Each relation declares its columns and authors one typed
   array for each, equal in length. This is what the markdown table it replaced could not
   carry: a packed row splits on whitespace, and a value with a space in it becomes two
   columns without saying so.

Run --self-test to see each check reject a known-bad input, because a check that passes on
broken input certifies the defect instead of catching it.
