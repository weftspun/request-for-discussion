"""Sample corpus renders: Mitsuba depth, keypoints coloured by See-Through layer in OKHSL.

WHAT IT WRITES, AND WHY IT IS ONE FILE. A PNG per view to look at, and one Lottie holding
everything else: 104 joints and 103 bones as vectors carrying their float positions, names,
parents and visibility, plus each view's depth pass embedded as a data-URI asset. Lottie takes
rasters the way SVG does, so the container never forces a choice between vectors and pixels.
Earlier revisions wrote OpenEXR, then a 32-bit PSB and a sidecar SVG; both are gone.

THE DEPTH STAYS EXACT, WHICH TOOK GETTING WRONG FIRST. A PNG channel is 8 bits and depth is a
32-bit float in metres, so the IEEE pattern is split across RGBA rather than scaled into a
range. That is lossless by construction and asserted on every write by decoding the bytes back
and comparing; a single flipped bit fails it. Scaling into 16-bit grey would have quantised this
render's 0.813 m span at 0.012 mm a step -- about a sixtieth of a credit card -- trading an
exact measurement for a smaller file.

ONLY DEPTH IS STORED. The matte is `depth > 0` and the shading is a ramp between the near and
far planes, so both are derivable and neither is written, for the same reason a parquet here
carries no derivable column.

WHAT THE COLOUR MEANS, which is the whole design:

    HUE            which See-Through layer the joint drives
    hue +/- 6 deg  which joint within that layer
    LIGHTNESS      position along the chain inside the layer
    SHAPE          visibility: filled if unoccluded, hollow if the surface is in front

RETRACTED: the first version spaced all 104 hues by the golden angle, to make neighbours
maximally distinct. That is the wrong objective here. It scatters the five finger joints of
one hand across the entire wheel, so nothing about the picture says they are one garment
region. Related layers should read as related.

WHY OKHSL AND NOT HSL. HSL lightness is not perceptual. At a fixed L an HSL sweep makes
yellows glare and blues sink, so a reader sees brightness differences that encode nothing and
misses the lightness differences that encode chain position. OKHSL holds perceived lightness
constant across hue, which is the only reason lightness is free to carry a second variable.

RETRACTED: IT IS 8 TAGS AND 16 WITHOUT A BONE, NOT 9 AND 15. This docstring said 9 until a
run printed 8, and the code could never have produced 9: `tag_for` has eight distinct return
values, so the count was wrong when written rather than having drifted. Measured on this
desk -- driven: bottomwear, footwear, handwear, head, irides, legwear, neck, topwear.

TAG ORDER IS ANATOMICAL, head to foot, so adjacent tags sit 15 degrees apart and the head
group, the leg group and so on each occupy a contiguous arc.

THE GAP THIS MAKES VISIBLE. ANNY drives 8 of See-Through's 24 tags. The other 16 have no bone
in the skeleton at all, and the legend lists them greyed rather than omitting them, because a
missing category that is simply absent from the picture reads as a category that does not
exist. This is the same finding RFD 0121 records: hair and garments are not modelled.

    projected joints do not travel in straight 2D lines while a camera swings around a body, so

    to be inaccurate. The only loss is the decimal places written, and the check below measures

# 20 mm, about thirteen stacked pennies. CORRECTED: this read "thirteen stacked credit
# cards" until a gate for unpaired measurements went looking. A credit card is 0.76 mm,
# so thirteen of them is 10 mm and twenty needs twenty-six; a penny is 1.52 mm and
# thirteen of those is 19.8 mm. The anchor was wrong by a factor of two, in the direction
# that made the tolerance sound tighter than it is. THIS NUMBER IS NOT SETTLED: joint centres sit
# inside the body, so a strict test calls every joint occluded and a loose one passes every
# joint. It decides a supervised label, so it needs deciding on its own terms.
#
# MEASURED, AND THE NUMBERS SAY IT IS WRONG RATHER THAN MERELY UNSETTLED. At this tolerance
# the rest pose reports 14 of 104 joints unoccluded from the front, 42 from three-quarter and
# 53 from the side. A front view showing the FEWEST visible joints is backwards: the front is
# where a viewer sees most of a body. What the test actually measures is how deep each joint
# centre sits beneath the surface along the view ray, and that is largest for a torso seen
# face-on, so the count tracks body thickness rather than visibility.
#
# It is left as it is, and reported, because changing it would be picking a number to make an
# output look right. Deciding it needs a definition of what a visible joint is -- surface
# depth at the projected pixel, or the joint's own radius -- and that is RFD 1122's work, not
# a constant to nudge here.
