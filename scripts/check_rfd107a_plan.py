"""Check `rfd107a-plan.usda` against RFD 107a, and against itself.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A plan written as prose can say step 8 depends on step 9 and nobody
notices. A plan written as a graph can too, unless something reads the graph. This reads
it: every `dependsOn` target must resolve, must have a strictly lower `order`, and the
`order` values must be 1..N with no gaps and no repeats. It found one defect while being
written -- the renderer sat at order 2 depending on the bake at order 3.

AND AGAINST THE DOCUMENT. Every count under /Rfd107a/Quantities is searched for in the
source documents with commas stripped, as a whole token. The stage is not allowed to be the
only place a number lives, because then the number is unreviewed and the RFD and the plan
can drift apart silently. This is the pattern `check-rfd-structure.py` uses for RFD 1000's
state list: read the claim out of the document rather than restating it.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK. Whether the plan is a good plan, and whether the counts are right
-- only that the two artefacts agree. A wrong number stated identically in both passes.

Usage:
    python check_rfd107a_plan.py [stage.usda] [--self-test]

Exit code is non-zero on any failure, and on any negative control that fails to fail.

# WHERE RFD 107a IS, AND THE THREE ANSWERS THIS LINE USED TO HAVE. It was `parents[2]`,
# which landed on `C:\`. Then `parents[1]`, right for exactly as long as the logbook sat
# at the workspace root as `.logbook`. Then a walk up to `.repo`, reading the checkout path
# for `request-for-discussion` out of `default.xml`, because the manifest is what decides
# where a project lives and it is allowed to move one tomorrow.
#
# All three were answering a question that no longer exists. The logbook moved into this
# repository, so RFD 107a is a sibling directory and there is nothing to locate. The
# manifest lookup is deleted rather than kept as a fallback: a fallback path is a path that
# is never exercised, and this one would have gone stale unnoticed.
#
# The gate ran as `stages: [manual]` for the whole of that history, for the reason the
# search existed -- CI checks a repository out on its own, so the other half of the pair
# was absent and the hook could not run. It is an ordinary hook now.

# what had actually happened is that it lives one document over.
#
# CLAUDE.md is read from this repository rather than from the workspace root. The root copy
