"""Check that every RFD document has the shape the corpus already uses.

The rules here were measured, not recalled. Each one was run against all 116
RFDs first, and only the rules that hold with no exception became checks. The
counts behind each decision, including the two conventions that were measured
and deliberately not gated, are in RFD 1124.

Every check reads a CommonMark AST rather than the bytes. That is not
decoration. The regex gate beside this one looks for `RFD 0123` in the raw
text, and an RFD wraps its prose at about 72 columns, so a citation split
across a line break was invisible to it. The AST joins a paragraph's inline
text before matching, which is the quantity the reader sees. On the corpus as
it stood, the byte scan found 3 unmigrated citations and this one found 37.

Run --self-test to see each check reject a known-bad input, because a check
that passes on broken input certifies the defect instead of catching it.
