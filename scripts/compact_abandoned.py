"""Compact the DETAILS.md of an abandoned RFD, leaving the README whole.

The anti-entropy check reads every pair and reports drift. This does the
opposite on purpose: an abandoned document's working-out is a dead end, and a
dead end costs context on every read. The stub keeps the title and the commit
the full text is in, so the road stays marked and still walkable. The README is
never touched. A README may keep its DETAILS with `<!-- retain-details -->`.
