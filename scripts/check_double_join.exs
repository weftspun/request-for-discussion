  Gate: a comparison joined twice.

  A comparison has one join in it — "X along the travel axis against Y across
  it". An edit that squeezes the sentence can drop a second join into the same
  place, and the result reads past a first pass. The specimen is from
  `anny-render-corpus/check_view_selection.py` and it shipped:

      "mean foot separation about five stacked soda cans along the travel axis and against three and a half across it"

  Neither reading works. If "and" is the join, the words after it are a loose
  "against ..." phrase with nothing to be joined to. If "against" is the join,
  then "and" joins one thing to nothing. The T01 entry it was compressing had
  one join and read fine: mean foot separation is 0.356 m along the travel
  axis, about five stacked soda cans, against 0.230 m across it, about three
  and a half.

  It happens when a sentence is shortened. Nobody writes this from scratch;
  it appears when a long sentence carrying a measurement, a household anchor
  and a comparison is squeezed and the seams are not re-read. That is the
  edit an agent makes most often, which is why it is a gate rather than a
  note.

  The vocabulary is deliberately plain. An earlier draft called this a
  "stacked connective", which is a phrase that has to be decoded before the
  reader can act on it. A gate's message is read by somebody who has just
  been interrupted, so it says "and" and "against" rather than naming the
  parts of speech they belong to.

  ## What is checked, and why it is this narrow

  A first version flagged "and" in front of any comparison word. Run over
  this repository it found the defect once and fired three times on correct
  prose:

      logbook-rfd0016-model-repos.md:118    "names what needs confirming and against which repo"
      logbook-rfd107a-t01-pose-check.md:157 "And against the image corpus."
      scripts/check_rfd107a_plan.py:1       "Check the plan against RFD 107a, and against itself."

  Three false alarms to one catch is a gate somebody switches off, so it
  carries three guards, each one earned by a line above:

    1. What follows the comparison word must be a NUMBER — a digit or a
       number word, allowing a hedge like about, roughly, nearly. "and
       against which repo" compares no measurements, and this gate is only
       about the ones that do.
    2. The "and" must not START THE SENTENCE. "And against the image corpus"
       puts the "against" phrase at the front, which is ordinary English.
    3. No "against" or "versus" may appear EARLIER IN THE SAME SENTENCE.
       "against RFD 107a, and against itself" is two "against" phrases
       joined, which is this construction done right.

  Two joining words in a row — "and but", "and and" — are flagged with no
  guard, because there is no reading in which that is right.

  ## Detection floor

  Guard 1 is what keeps the noise down and it is also most of the floor:
  the same sentence broken between two things that are not numbers reads
  exactly as badly and is not caught here. Three further known misses:

    - "and rather than" and "and instead of". Both open a clause perfectly
      well — "and rather than assume it, we measured" — so flagging them
      would fire on correct prose more often than on broken prose.
    - "against" followed by "and". "weighed against the alternative and
      found wanting" is fine, so that order cannot be called an error from
      adjacency alone.
    - Repetition that still parses. The same specimen also said "picking a
      front view picked by hand", which is one word doing its job twice
      rather than a broken comparison. It reads badly and it reads; this
      gate only claims the sentences that do not.

  So a pass here is not a claim that the prose is good. It is a claim that
  no sentence in it joins a comparison of two measurements twice, which is
  one named defect out of many.

  ## Use, not mention

  The paragraphs above contain the specimen and three false alarms, so the
  gate would fail its own file if it counted every occurrence.
  Double-quoted spans are blanked before scanning — blanked rather than
  deleted, so offsets and line numbers still point at the text the author
  wrote. This is the convention `check_household_units.exs` and
  `check_prose_tropes.exs` arrived at, and the specimen block above is
  quoted for that reason as well as for reading.

  ## Usage

      elixir scripts/check_double_join.exs [<repo>] [--base <ref>]
      elixir scripts/check_double_join.exs --self-test
      elixir scripts/check_double_join.exs --file <path> [<path> ...]

  Exit codes: 0 nothing joined twice, 1 one or more found, 2 bad usage.

  ## Regex assembly note

  The word boundary goes inside each alternative in `@joined_twice`; a
  first version put one after the group instead, and `vs.` ends on a
  period so the position after it has a non-word character on both sides
  and `\\b` does not hold — the abbreviation the gate was written to
  catch was the one form it let through. A control asserts it.

  `@boundary` recognises: a full stop then a space, a blank line, or a
  line that opens a markdown block. A single newline is NOT a boundary —
  prose here is hard-wrapped, so treating one as a sentence break would
  hide the earlier "against" that guard 3 looks for. A full stop inside
  a decimal is not one either, because it has no space after it.
