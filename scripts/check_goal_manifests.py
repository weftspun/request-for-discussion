"""Gate: every goal manifest CLAUDE.md names as live is actually live.

The Sides rule decides where a repository is placed, and it decides it
by NAMING a manifest. That name has now gone stale twice.
`weftspun/weftspun` was archived and the rule went on naming it, which
`KEYPOINTS.md` records two agents fixing independently within an hour.
The replacement wording named two manifests, `weftspun-mesh-latents`
was archived on 2026-08-22, and the rule went on naming that one for
two days — in a paragraph that states exactly the test it was failing.

Twice is a class, not an instance. CLAUDE.md's own obligation covers
it: where a document states a rule, that statement should be
machine-checked against live code, so drift fails a command rather than
being discovered six months later.

## What it checks

Every `weftspun/<name>` in the Sides rule that the prose calls live,
against the organisation's archived set. An archived repository named
as live is a FAIL.

## What it does not check

Whether the named manifest is the RIGHT one, or whether a project
inside it is placed correctly. It answers one question — is this name
still a live manifest — which is the question that rotted.
