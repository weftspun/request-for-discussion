"""Gate: every USD layer we write is valid, and survives a round trip through crate.

`rfd1122-plan.usda` opened in Python, composed without error, and read back
the ten tasks it was supposed to carry — and it still failed usdchecker's
own rules, because it declared neither `upAxis` nor `metersPerUnit`. "It
opens" is not "it is valid", and the gap between the two is exactly where
a layer that other tools reject sits looking fine. RFD 1035 makes OpenUSD
the internal format, so a layer nothing else will take is a layer that has
not been written yet.

## Three things checked, and why each is separate

1. PARSE. `Sdf.Layer.FindOrOpen` on the file itself. A malformed layer fails here.
2. COMPOSE, then VALIDATE. `Usd.Stage.Open` reports composition errors;
   `UsdValidation` runs every registered validator, which is the machinery
   `usdchecker` drives. An Error fails the gate and a Warning is printed
   and counted — named, never omitted.
3. ROUND TRIP. Export to `.usdc`, reopen, export back to `.usda`, and
   compare the two stages by content. A layer that parses but does not
   survive the binary format is not portable, and .usda is the source form
   here rather than the wire form.

## What the round-trip comparison ignores

Exporting a composed stage appends "Generated from Composed Stage of root
layer <path>" to the layer's documentation, so a naive string equality
reports every file as broken. That line is an artefact of the exporter,
it names a temporary path, and comparing it would make the gate fail on
files that are fine. Everything else is compared: prim paths, types,
specifiers, metadata, every authored attribute name, type and value, and
every relationship's targets. The first version of this compared exported
strings and reported the plan stage as DIFFERING on nothing but that
stamp.

## Where the temporaries go

`.local` at the workspace root when it is there, which is what CLAUDE.md
asks for. In CI the logbook is checked out on its own and there is no
workspace root, so a temporary directory is used and the run says which it
chose. A gate that cannot run in CI is a gate nobody runs.

## Skipped directories

`.git` was always here; `.pixi` arrived when this repository gained a
declared environment, and it carries OpenUSD's own schema templates —
`schemaUserDoc.usda` and its neighbours, which do not resolve outside the
package that ships them. Walking them made this gate exit non-zero while
its last printed line still read "ok", so a reader tailing the output saw
a pass. CI never hit it: prek passes this hook git-tracked files, and
`.pixi` stays untracked.

## Usage

    python check_usd_valid.py [path ...]      default: every USD file in the repo
    python check_usd_valid.py --self-test     the negative controls, each must FAIL

Exit code is non-zero on any invalid layer, and on any control that fails
to fail.

    A distinct filename per control. USD caches layers by identifier, so
    reusing one hands the next control the previous one's layer —

    still printed FAIL while three of them were reporting the second one's
    defect.

    The round-trip arm has no file-shaped control, because a layer that
    parses and then changes under export is exactly the bug this looks for
    and cannot be written to order. So the comparison is exercised
    directly: change one value and it must be reported.

    What none of this catches, recorded because the control that was here
    first assumed otherwise: writing `custom int order = 1.5` does not
    fail — USD's text parser truncates it to 1 silently, and `= 10`
    mangled the same way also becomes 1. The layer then parses, validates
    and round-trips perfectly while carrying two tasks numbered 1. Value
    corruption is invisible at the USD level by construction, which is
    the division of labour with `check_rfd1122_plan.py` — this gate says
