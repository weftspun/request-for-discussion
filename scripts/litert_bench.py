"""What LiteRT's Metal accelerator reaches on this machine, against Core ML's figure.

RFD 1148 chose LiteRT and RFD 1142 measured Core ML's Metal path at 6.97 TFLOP/s fp16.
This is the other half of that comparison, on the same `ConvStack` and the same
convention, so the two rows compose.

THE ACCELERATOR IS PREBUILT AND CANNOT BE OTHERWISE. `libLiteRtMetalAccelerator.dylib`
ships inside the wheel. No LiteRT GPU accelerator builds from the public tree: WORKSPACE
declares `ml_drift` as an http_archive with no url, and ml-drift is not a public
repository. So this measures what Google shipped rather than what we compiled.

PLACEMENT IS REPORTED, NEVER ASSUMED. `is_fully_accelerated()` is LiteRT's own answer to
"did the accelerator take the whole graph", and it is the equivalent of the MLComputePlan
fraction that stopped an ANE row being read as a GPU row. A timing without it is a number
about an unknown device.

THE ORACLE IS TORCH ON CPU. `gate_onnx_device.py` diffed against PyTorch and ONNX is
retired as an interchange, so the reference moves to the module the graph came from.

    ONE MEDIAN OF FIFTY REPETITIONS FAILS TO SETTLE THIS. Measured on this machine, the
    median moves 74% between rounds -- 0.35 ms to 0.61 ms for the same configuration and
    the same flatbuffer. Running each configuration to completion in turn attributes that
    drift to whichever ran second, which is how an ordering artefact becomes a result.
    So the configurations interleave, every round, and the spread is reported beside the
    rate rather than hidden by it.

    The rate uses the FASTEST round. A GPU sharing a machine with a browser is contended,
    and contention only ever subtracts, so the floor of the observed distribution is the
    closer estimate of what the part can do. The spread says how much to trust it.

    THE ORDER ALTERNATES, AND THE REASON IS A RESULT RATHER THAN A PRECAUTION. Measured
    with a fixed order, whichever GPU configuration ran first won: fp16 first gave
    fp16 0.38 ms against f32 0.40, and f32 first gave f32 0.45 against fp16 0.48. The
    ranking followed the order rather than the arithmetic, so the difference between fp16
    and f32 at this size is smaller than the artefact and this harness cannot rank them.
    It reports both and says so.
