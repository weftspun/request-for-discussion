"""Check `fourloops-etnf.usda` against itself and against the code it describes.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The ETNF layer is a design written down: which relations exist, which
columns each carries, which stage writes it, and which columns are deliberately absent
because they are derivable. A design written down and never checked is a design that was
true the afternoon somebody typed it. `check_fourloops_plan.py` reads the task graph beside
this layer; nothing read the schema, so a relation could lose its writer, a foreign key
could point at a prim that had been renamed, and the four ETNF rules the layer argues for
could each be violated by the layer itself without a word.

A relationship whose target does not exist composes without complaint -- `Usd` reports no
error for it, and `usdchecker` does not either, which is why `check_usd_valid.py` passing is
not this file passing.

WHAT IT CHECKS, and why each is separate.

1. SHAPE. Every relation declares a `kind` drawn from `relationKindVocabulary` and a
   `columns` list, and every `state` is drawn from `stateVocabulary`. A vocabulary stated in
   a layer and gated nowhere is two vocabularies.

2. TARGETS RESOLVE. Every relationship target names a prim that exists. This is the dangling
   foreign key, and composition is blind to it.

3. NO DERIVABLE COLUMN IS STORED. Every column named under `Absent` appears in no relation's
   `columns`. The fourth ETNF rule is the one that rots quietly: somebody adds `yaw` beside
   `hammersley_index` for convenience, and the layer now stores a camera it also says it
   does not store.

4. EVERY EMITTED RELATION HAS EXACTLY ONE WRITER. Every relation of kind `spine`,
   `satellite` or `measured` is the target of exactly one `writes` under `StageWrites`.
   Interned vocabularies are exempt, which is what interned means. A relation two stages
   write is a relation with no owner; one nothing writes is a relation that does not exist
   yet, however carefully its columns are described. This check is what found
   `ArmUnavailable`, which the layer described and no stage wrote.

5. COUNTS ARE NOT ONLY HERE. Every number in the layer is searched for in the sources the
   layer names, commas stripped, as a whole token. A count that lives only in the design is
   a count nobody reviewed. Same pattern as `check_fourloops_plan.py` and, before it,
   `check-rfd-structure.py` for RFD 1000.

   SMALL INTEGERS ARE CHECKED IN CONTEXT, NOT SKIPPED. The first version of this gate had a
   detection floor: integers below `SEARCH_FLOOR` went unsearched, because `4` appears in
   every Python file ever written and matching it certifies nothing. They were printed
   rather than hidden, but twelve numbers were asserted and not checked, which is a hole in
   a gate whose whole point is that a number does not live only here.

   The floor is retracted and replaced by three checks that each say something:

   a. `order` values are structural, so they are read as a sequence: 1..N within their
      scope, no gaps and no repeats. No source search could ever have verified them.
   b. A `rowCount` beside an authored `rows` list must equal that list's length. The
      vocabulary is in the layer, so the count is checkable without leaving it.
   c. Every other small integer must appear in a source NEAR A WORD FROM ITS OWN NAME,
      spelled as a digit or as an English word. `planSteps = 7` is satisfied by "the same 7
      steps" and `Regions.rowCount = 5` by "across all five regions"; a bare 7 somewhere in
      the corpus satisfies neither.

      The word has to name the SUBJECT and not the shape, which is why `STEM_STOPWORDS`
      exists: `Regions.rowCount = 5` first passed against "the counts from 18 visible and 5
      occluded", a sentence about joints in a render. The right digit beside the wrong noun
      is a pass the gate had not earned.

   Anything still unchecked must be named in the layer's `uncheckedIntegers`, which this
   gate prints and counts, and which fails when it names something that is checked after
   all. Declared-unchecked is a position somebody took; silently skipped is not.

   Integers at or above the floor keep the plain whole-token search, and floats are searched
   whatever their magnitude: 19158 and 0.263 mean something on their own, where 5 does not.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK. Whether the schema is a good schema, and whether any of these
relations exists in a database -- nothing builds one yet. Only that the design is
self-consistent and that its numbers came from somewhere a person can read.

    python check_fourloops_etnf.py [layer.usda] [--self-test]

Exit code is non-zero on any failure, and on any negative control that fails to fail.
