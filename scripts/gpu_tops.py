"""Measured throughput for the devices in RFD 1122's plan, against their derived peak rates.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `rfd1122-plan.usda`'s Devices scope carries peak rates DERIVED from
architecture -- units x lanes x 2 for the fused multiply-add x clock -- and every clock in it is
a vendor boost figure marked ASSUMED. `check_rfd1122_plan.py` re-derives the arithmetic, which
catches a transcription error and nothing else: a derivation cannot tell you whether a device
reaches its peak, and the plan currently scales GPU-bound work by ratios of numbers no one has
observed.

`logbook-edge-npu-and-the-anny-forward.md` set the convention this answers to. It divides by
40 TOPS INT4 at an ASSUMED 30% utilisation and says plainly to "treat those as a ranking and
not a budget", because the DFC profiler was never run. This runs the profiler for the one
device that is here.

METHOD, AND IT IS THE ORDINARY ONE. Dense GEMM, C = A @ B at (n, n) @ (n, n), which costs
exactly 2*n^3 floating-point operations -- n^3 multiplies and n^3 adds, the fused pair counted
as two, the same convention the derived peak uses. Anything else measures a kernel author. Sizes
are swept because a single size measures a cache; the best rate over the sweep is what the
device reaches. The device is synchronised before and after, since an asynchronous queue times
the enqueue rather than the work -- which is the trap `mi_bench2.py` records paying for.

WHAT A RATIO TO PEAK DOES AND DOES NOT MEAN. GEMM is the friendliest shape a device sees. A
number here is an upper bound on what real work reaches, so a low ratio is evidence and a high
one is not a promise.
