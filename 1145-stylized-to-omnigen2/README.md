# RFD 1145: The stylized-to-OmniGen2 loop

**State:** published
**Feature:** loop 3 of the four-loop plan
**Scope:** `2-contract/weftspun-manuals/fourloops-plan.usda`

## Problem

Loop 3 is loop 2 with a style transfer in front of it: CycleGAN
proposes a restyled image, OmniGen2 edits it, EditScore scores the
result and OmniGen2 repairs. The artifact is an edited png and the size
is M, the same as loop 2.

What makes it a separate loop rather than a variant is where its input
comes from, and that is a licensing question before it is a technical
one.

## Decision

Run it, and treat everything it touches as evaluation only.

**The hazard is the holdout.** The COCO-OOD stylized sets are
`val2017` restyled, so they are held out twice over: derived from the
blinded holdout, and generated. CLAUDE.md states the rule this loop is
most likely to break — anything derived from `val2017` inherits its
status, and a set generated from a held-out photo carries that photo's
content wherever it goes.

So loop 3 produces no training data, whatever it produces. A stylized
corpus that reaches a training run has taken the holdout with it, and
nothing downstream would report that it had.

RFD 1143, RFD 1144 and RFD 1146 are the other three loops. RFD 1122 is
the goal that the four serve.
