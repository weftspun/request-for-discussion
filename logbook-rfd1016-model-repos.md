# Logbook: RFD 1016 model-repo build-out

Source: [RFD 1016's inventory table](https://github.com/weftspun/request-for-discussion/blob/main/1016-deep-learning-model-inventory/DETAILS.md)
(15 models). Per the user's explicit override, one standalone repo per model — not RFD 1036's
"one repo, many folders" convention.

## Scope decided

- **15 catalog entries total.**
- **1 already satisfied elsewhere**: `misamaru_seethrough` — covered by the existing
  `interactor-seethrough-ggml` / `interactor-seethrough-torch` repos from earlier in this work.
- **4 abandoned**, no repo created, per each RFD's own `State: abandoned` field
  (RFD 1064's pivot away from scene/world reconstruction toward character concepts):
  `worldmirror2_reconstruct`, `triposplat_image_to_splat`, `weftspun_image_to_world`,
  `lingbot_map_environment_scan`.
- **10 repos built** — the rest of this log.

## The 10 repos, in priority order

Priority = how ready each is to actually run for real, not the order built in. Ranked by: does it
unblock other repos, is the license clean and confirmed, and is the upstream API already verified
(vs. still an honest `NotImplementedError`).

## Amended: two of those rankings did not survive being run

The table above ranked by readiness, and readiness was judged from licences and API surfaces
rather than from execution. Two rows have since been executed. Both moved, and one moved off the
list entirely.

**#3 `interactor-qwen-image-edit` is blocklisted.** Its stated gap was that the diffusers call
"isn't verified yet". It is verified now and it fails. Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 is 20.43B parameters
needing about 38 GB at bf16 against this desk's 24 GB, so it runs quantised or not at all — and
quantised weights do not produce corpus data, which is generated-synthetic condition 5. The
quantised path is also broken rather than merely forbidden: at NF4 it peaks at 11.9 GiB and
speckles every pixel, scoring 0.098 to 0.719 on silhouette agreement against a control of 0.222.

Three explanations were eliminated rather than assumed. Not the torch version, since the
corruption `interactor-pixal3d` recorded under torch 2.4.1 reproduces unchanged on 2.11.0+cu128.
Not the guidance, since diffusers silently ignores `true_cfg_scale` when no negative prompt is
supplied and enabling it changed nothing. Not the input, since OmniGen2 edits the same render
cleanly. 8-bit would have isolated the quantiser and cannot run here: step 3 of 30 at 4,925 s/it
with 42 GB resident, 37 hours projected for one image.

The ranking's own logic is what to correct, not just the row. "Clean licence, standalone, high
catalog value" was true of this model and told us nothing about whether it works: Apache-2.0 in
base and control alike, and unusable on the only hardware we have. A readiness table that never
runs anything ranks paperwork.

**#2 `interactor-pixal3d-image-to-textured-mesh` is not ship-ready.** It is described as
verbatim-complete with no `NotImplementedError` anywhere, which is true of the code and not of
the image. Its `requirements-hfdemo.txt` pins a natten wheel whose kernels are **sm_90 only** —
182 cubins, all sm_90a, and no PTX at all, read off the wheel with `cuobjdump` — so on any
non-Hopper rental it imports cleanly and then dies inside a diffusion step. vast.ai rents
whatever is free. Triton also JIT-compiles a C shim on first launch, so a compiler and the
python headers are runtime dependencies of an image that compiles nothing.

Separately, the base image that produced its two sample meshes is gone: `weftspun-pixal3d:cdbb2bb`
was never pushed to a registry, its recipe was never tracked, and both Docker contexts now report
zero images. What survives is a digest in a build log that fetches nothing.

**#9 `interactor-krea2-turbo-text-to-image` is blocklisted, on the ground this table already
named.** The row called its licence "revenue-gated ... clears the bar for a small deployer, not
for every possible customer" and ranked it 9 rather than excluding it. That flag is now
resolved: a use restriction whose satisfaction depends on who deploys the trained model cannot
be gated on when the corpus is built, which is the same reasoning that blocks OpenRAIL-M as a
generator.

A second reason arrived independently. The row's plan was the Q4_K_M GGUF set, since 33.8 GB
bf16 is what made quantisation necessary — and quantised weights do not produce corpus data.
The shape that made the model affordable is the shape that disqualifies its output, so the plan
on file could not have produced usable corpus even with the licence resolved.

**#10 `interactor-p3sam-mesh-segmentation` is blocklisted.** The row ranked it last because
"the licence is a real, unresolved gate", and it is now resolved as a block rather than as a
correction to make. Tencent's Community License Agreement excludes the EU, the UK and South
Korea, so the constraint is on who may run the tool rather than on what its output may do — and
that is invisible to every check this workspace has. RFD 1041's own record still says MIT.

**OmniGen2 is the replacement for the editing slot**, and it needs no exception: 7.8B,
Apache-2.0 in weights and code, 17.3 GiB at bf16, clean output on the same input that defeated
Qwen. At NF4 it fits 8 GB — 4.33 GiB of weights, 6.72 GiB peak — which is the only figure here
that speaks to the ASUS UGen300, though fitting the memory is not the same as compiling for the
device.

## License corrections made to the org's own record

Two RFDs stated a license that didn't match the real upstream when checked directly:

- **RFD 1041** says P3-SAM is MIT. Real upstream (`Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-Part`) is under
  Tencent's own Community License Agreement, territory-restricted. Not propagated — the new
  repo's README marks it "review pending" and documents the discrepancy.
- **RFD 1046** marks SkinTokens' license "review pending". Real upstream
  (`VAST-AI-Research/SkinTokens`) has a plain MIT `LICENSE` file — not ambiguous. Resolved to
  MIT in the new repo, documented for RFD 1046's owner to close out.

One RFD (1045, Kimodo) simply didn't record a weight license at all — resolved by reading
`nv-tlabs/kimodo`'s own README: code is Apache-2.0, but checkpoints are licensed **per variant**
(Kimodo-SOMA/-G1: NVIDIA Open Model License; Kimodo-SMPLX: NVIDIA R&D Model License, more
restrictive). The new repo pins to Kimodo-SOMA specifically and documents why.

## Known gaps left honest, not papered over

Every repo above the pixal3d line (which is verbatim-complete) has at least one
`NotImplementedError` in `server.py` for a step whose real upstream call wasn't verified in this
pass — each one names exactly what needs confirming and against which upstream repo. None of these
were guessed and left silent; `STUB` mode proves the request/response shape and (for the two
composite VoxHammer repos) the dispatch order, without needing the real model.

## Not done this pass (carried forward from earlier in the session, unrelated to RFD 1016)

- Retrofitting nlohmann/json + OpenSSL base64, and swapping libcurl for h2o as the HTTP client,
  across `transport-runpod` / `interactor-qwen35-defiant` / `interactor-gemma4-composer` /
  `runpod-chat-tui`. Started, not finished.
