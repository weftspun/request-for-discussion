## Context and problem statement

Every hexagonal core (`rfd/2028-hexagonal-core-ports-adapters`) needs
to be replayable, snapshot-able, fixture-testable, and
transport-agnostic. A core that hides mutable state behind methods
defeats all four.

## Considered options

- Stateful objects whose internal state lives behind methods.
- A pure reducer over an explicit, serializable state value.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: model each core as a pure reducer,
`step : State -> Event -> State x Effects`, with `State`, `Event`, and
`Effects` serialized to bytes deterministically, so the core is bytes
to bytes. The flat C ABI exposes `step` plus `snapshot` and `restore`
over the byte state, and the compute kernels lower through
`rfd/2032-core-codegen-lean-slang` to SPIR-V, dispatched on the GPU.
Hidden mutable state defeats snapshots and exact fixtures, so the
first option loses replay and rollback.

With `rfd/2034-deterministic-cores-integer-seeded-rng`, this makes
replay byte-exact and snapshots a value copy.

## Consequences

- Snapshots and rollback are copies of the state bytes.
- Fixtures pin exact output bytes, so a divergence shows up as a
  failing fixture.
- The same `step` backs every adapter, so `webtransportd` and the
  engine carry the same bytes.

## Confirmation

Replaying an event log reproduces the state bytes on every target.
