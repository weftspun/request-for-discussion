## What requires the editor today

| Step   | Mechanism                                                         | Available in a template |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Import | `editor/import/*`, writing `res://.godot/imported/`               | No                      |
| Export | `--export-release`, `--export-debug`, implemented under `editor/` | No                      |

Everything else a client does at runtime is already outside `editor/`. `ResourceFormatLoaderText` reads `.tscn`,
`GLTFDocument` reads glTF, and the Basis transcoder reads supercompressed textures. All three compile into
`target=template_release`.

## Why the mount is a module

`PackedData` accepts additional backends through `PackSource`, which is how the `.pck` reader and the ZIP reader are
both registered. A third source resolving `res://` against a directory or a chunk store is the same shape of object.

The registration has to happen at core initialization. A GDExtension library loads after the filesystem is already
serving, which is late enough that boot resources have been requested and failed. A module registered at
`MODULE_INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_CORE` is in place before the first request.

The usual argument against a module is that it costs an engine rebuild. `godot-images` already builds the engine for
every platform on every run, so that cost is already paid.

## Three ways this fails quietly

`#ifdef TOOLS_ENABLED` around the registration. `template_release` strips the define, so the block disappears: the
module compiles, the template links, and `res://` resolves to nothing with no diagnostic naming the cause.

An unstable `uid://`. Godot 4 `.tscn` refers to external resources by UID. A baker that generates a fresh UID per run
produces scenes whose references break on the second bake. Emitting plain `res://` paths avoids the class of bug
entirely.

A reference to an importable file. `res://foo.png` inside a baked `.tscn` reintroduces the import step for one asset
and takes the editor back with it. Every external reference has to name a runtime-loadable file or live inside the
glTF.

## What is already true

- `entities-godot` carries `modules/basis_universal` and `modules/gltf`.
- `godot-images` has no `module_*_enabled=no` on any platform, so both are in every artifact it publishes.
- `zone-client-godot` builds `scons platform=web target=template_release` and ships `bin/godot.web.template_release.*`
  with no editor involved.
- `godot-images` now releases `windows-template-release.zip` and `linux-template-release.zip` alone. The editors still
  build, and `build-docker` still publishes `godot-editor-double` from that target.

## Alternatives considered

Keep the editor headless in CI. This works today and is what happens now. It keeps a 482 MB GUI binary in the
pipeline to perform a step whose inputs the baker already holds, and it keeps import as a build stage that content
delivered at runtime never passes through.

Commit `res://.godot/imported/`. This removes the import step from CI by moving its output into version control. The
artifacts are engine-version-specific and binary, so an engine bump invalidates all of them at once, and review sees
no meaningful diff.

Pre-pack with a third-party `.pck` writer. The format is documented and writers exist. This solves export without
solving import, so the editor stays for textures and meshes. It remains the fallback if the pack source proves harder
than expected.

Emit binary `.scn` instead of `.tscn`. Loading is faster. The binary format's compatibility across engine versions is
a weaker contract for a baker to hold than the text format's, and the parse cost is paid once per scene load against
a network fetch that costs more.

## Consequences

The pipeline becomes scons for the template, the baker for the content, the module for the mount, and the sandbox for
the logic. No step needs a GUI, and no step needs a machine with the editor installed.

The module is the new failure surface. Three ways it fails quietly are recorded in `DETAILS.md`, and the first one
compiles, links, and resolves nothing.

## Open question

Whether a release template boots an unpacked project directory or requires a `.pck`. The module answers this by
construction once it exists. Until it does, the question is unsettled and a short experiment against
`linux-template-release` would settle it.
