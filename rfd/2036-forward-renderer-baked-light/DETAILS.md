## Context and problem statement

The mobile tile renderer rations bandwidth across file, memory, and
network IO, and deferred rendering competes for it. The slice needs
predictable frame cost regardless of light count.

## Considered options

- Deferred rendering.
- A simple forward renderer with baked global illumination.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: a simple forward renderer with baked global
illumination and light probes for static geometry, a dedicated shadow
pass for avatars, and probe lighting for dynamic entities, because the
frame cost stays predictable regardless of light count. Deferred
rendering pressures the bandwidth the mobile tile renderer rations.

## Consequences

- Frame cost stays predictable, so artists place many lights without
  watching the budget.
- Dynamic entities take lower-fidelity probe lighting.
- The renderer removes one axis the small team otherwise tunes by
  hand.

## Confirmation

The Field room holds the frame floor on the standalone VR build with
many lights placed.
