# RFD 2161 details: cleanroom VN-avatar on the MaskScore stack

## Retractions from the 2026-09-01 compute ladder

The session that filed this RFD climbed down five rungs of a compute
ladder. Each pivot's reason is recorded so a future reader does not
reopen the same bets.

1. **"Rent an RTX 3090 on Vast"**; two cheapest-tier hosts failed to
   spin up (bad GPU error, image never pulled). Spent $0.003 total
   before pivoting. The Vast market-snapshot dataset survives at
   `6-datasource/vast-market-snapshots/` (three ETNF Parquet snapshots
   with 40% churn per ~12 min at the hot $0.18-0.22 band; Wilson
   95%-lower on pooled 3-snapshot evidence).
2. **"Qwen3-Omni-30B does thinker + talker + OmniScore reward"** ;
   RETRACTED. The team behind Qwen3-Omni was disbanded (operator
   report), and no true-QAFT 4-bit checkpoint exists upstream for it
   or for Wan-VACE 14B, Pixal3D, VoxHammer, MoGe-3. Full QAFT training
   sized at ~$7-15K compute we do not have.
3. **"Gemma-4-31B-it-qat as the visual-LLM replacement"**; RETRACTED.
   Google publishes it (apache-2.0, image-text-to-text), but 62.6 GB
   fp16 exceeds the shipping budget once compute constraints landed.
   The mirror plan for `chibifire/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-*` never fired.
4. **"Gemma-4-E4B-it-qat + train EditScore LoRA ourselves"** ;
   RETRACTED at the smoke stage. EditScore already published its own
   LoRA over Qwen3-VL-4B (`EditScore/EditScore-Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct`,
   270 MB, apache-2.0 inheriting from base). Training a duplicate
   would burn compute we don't have to reproduce upstream work.
5. **"Vision encoder split onto Hailo NPU via QFT"**; PARKED. No
   Linux x86_64 host to run the proprietary DFC wheel, no Hailo
   hardware to deploy to. Scaffold survives at
   `3-interactor/editscore-lora-qwen3vl-4b/scripts/gate_vision_encoder.py`
   with a real ONNX export the DFC-side gate can consume when hardware
   arrives.

## The stack that landed

| role | model | licence | footprint on Mac mini M2 Pro 32 GB |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visual LLM + reward | `mlx-community/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-4bit` + `EditScore/EditScore-Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct` LoRA | apache-2.0 | **3.1 GB base + 270 MB adapter, ~0.9 s load, ~1.9 s first token** |
| TTS voice-clone | `ResembleAI/chatterbox` | mit | ~500 MB, MPS or CPU |
| STT | `whisper-small` or `distil-whisper` via MLX | mit | ~500 MB |
| VAD | `silero-vad` | mit | tiny |
| Viseme (MFCC -> SOMA) | cleanroom small classifier | ours | negligible |
| Body | ANNY + SOMA rig | ours | fits |
| Renderer | Godot 4.7 via `lib_godot_connector` | mit | fits |
| Locations | `6-datasource/{kenney,thebasemesh,quaternius}-stage` | cc-* clean | assets on disk |

**One real inference proved on Mac mini M2 Pro 32 GB (2026-09-01):**
`scripts/smoke_editscore_mlx.py` in `3-interactor/editscore-lora-qwen3vl-4b/`
loaded the MLX 4-bit Qwen3-VL-4B in 0.9 s and generated a one-token
reward response in 1.9 s from a dummy 224x224 image + edit-instruction
prompt. Wiring holds; real numbers arrive with real (image, edit) pairs.

## Compute pivot: Mac mini -> Windows 11 + RTX 3090

The operator is moving to Windows 11 with an RTX 3090 (24 GB). That
changes what becomes viable, in dependency order:

1. **QAFT-LoRA training on Qwen3-VL-4B against `EditScore/EditScore-Reward-Data`
  (97,300 rows, 161.8 GB, apache-2.0)** returns to the table. The
  `3-interactor/editscore-lora-qwen3vl-4b/scripts/smoke.py` scaffold
  targets this exactly; needs `bitsandbytes` (already linux-64
  target-scoped in `pixi.toml`; add `win-64` when the Windows path is
  real). Model VRAM footprint: Qwen3-VL-4B fp16 ~8.9 GB + optimizer
  state + gradients fits 24 GB comfortably at LoRA rank 32.
2. **Larger reward candidates** (`EditScore/EditScore-Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct`,
  `EditScore/EditScore-7B`, `EditScore/EditScore-32B`) become tractable
  at inference on the 3090. The 4B stays as the Mac-mini reference.
3. **Wan-VACE 14B NF4** (~8.7 GB) fits alongside the reward model on
  the 3090 with swap. Reopens the image-generation slot RFD 1173
  originally sized for.
4. **Hailo track** stays parked; 3090 does not change Linux/DFC gap.

## Original substitution table (retained for the record)

The target space's `README.md` (fetched cleanroom, README only) names
`gemma-4-31B-it on Cerebras` as its assistant model. The final
substitution collapses onto EditScore's own release; the intermediate
Gemma-4 mapping is retained here so the retraction trail is legible.

## True-QAFT-only mirror candidates (2026-09-01, refined)

The target space's README (fetched cleanroom, README only) names
`gemma-4-31B-it on Cerebras` as the assistant model; Google's own
release. Google publishes true-QAFT (quantization-aware training)
variants for the entire Gemma 4 lineup, including the target's exact
size. Community forks named "-qat" are excluded because their true-
QAT provenance is not verifiable without vetting each individually.

**Vendor-QAFT candidates from `google/` (all Gemma Terms of Use):**

| candidate                                              | format                 | note                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `google/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-w4a16-ct`                   | Compressed-Tensors W4A16 | target's exact model; not GGUF, no blocklist question           |
| `google/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-q4_0-gguf`                  | GGUF Q4_0              | same model, GGUF (vendor-runtime exemption via llama.cpp)       |
| `google/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized`           | fp16 (QAT-trained)     | for further fine-tuning on top of QAT weights                   |
| `google/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-q4_0-gguf`              | GGUF                   | 26B MoE (4B active); same shape as Qwen3-Omni                  |
| `google/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-w4a16-ct`                   | CT W4A16               | matches workspace's `gemma4-composer` size                      |
| `google/gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-w4a16-ct`                   | CT W4A16               | effective 4B                                                    |
| `google/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-w4a16-ct`                   | CT W4A16               | effective 2B                                                    |

## PTQ-only variants (dropped, not true-QAFT)

All other 4-bit variants surveyed for these families use post-training
quantization, not QAT: `Intel/...int4-AutoRound`, every AWQ (including
`Sabomako/...heretic-AWQ-4bit`; the licence-less community fork noted
in an earlier pass), every GPTQ, every bitsandbytes NF4. Recorded here
so a future session does not re-derive their presence and mistake them
for QAT-refined weights.

## MaskScore-stack models (RFD 1173)

Zero true-QAFT 4-bit checkpoints on Hub as of 2026-09-01 for any of:
Qwen3-Omni-30B, Wan-VACE 14B, Pixal3D, VoxHammer, MoGe-3. PTQ variants
exist for the first two only.

**True QAFT means the model was retrained with a fake-quant simulator
in the loop** (quantization-aware fine-tuning), so NF4 becomes its
published precision. PTQ methods (AutoRound, AWQ, GPTQ, bitsandbytes,
int8-convrot, GGUF) do not qualify: they take a released fp16 checkpoint
and quantize it after the fact, no re-training.

Hub was searched for each of the five MaskScore-stack model families
(RFD 1173) using both the family name and QAFT-specific naming
conventions (`QAFT`, `QAT`, `-qat`, `quantization-aware`).

| model family              | true-QAFT 4-bit upstream | PTQ-4-bit exists?                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Qwen3-Omni-30B (Instruct) | **none**                 | yes; `Intel/...int4-AutoRound` (AutoRound), several AWQ variants |
| Qwen3-Omni-30B (Thinking) | **none**                 | yes; Sabomako AWQ (source has no licence)                        |
| Wan-VACE 14B              | **none**                 | only FP8 / INT8 / GGUF (GGUF blocklisted); no 4-bit at all        |
| Pixal3D                   | **none**                 | no quant variants at all                                          |
| VoxHammer                 | **none**                 | no quant variants at all                                          |
| MoGe-3                    | **none**                 | no quant variants at all                                          |

**Nothing was mirrored** because operator scope is true QAFT only,
and zero true-QAFT 4-bit checkpoints for any of the five exist
upstream today. Reproducing the survey: `python3` + `huggingface_hub`
`list_models(search=<needle>)` filtered client-side for
`{QAFT, qaft, -qat, quantization-aware}` in the repo id.

`heretic` (ARA) and `abliterated` are **different** guard-lifting
techniques; the workspace blocklist row on abliterated weights does
not extend to heretic. Not relevant to the mirror decision here
because Sabomako's heretic variant is also PTQ (AWQ), not QAFT.

## What the spec side read (its only inputs)

1. `https://huggingface.co/spaces/victor/gemma-avatar/raw/main/README.md`
  (README only; the space's source tree was not opened).
2. The operator's VN twist: "visual novel style travel between
  different locations and pop up talking head interactions via
  prompts."

The implementer side must not open any other file in that space.

## Language boundaries

1. **Elixir**; Router, WebSocket, taskweft interpreter, MASKSCORE writer, USD writer.
2. **Python**; one file per model worker (`env_bus_server.py` shape).
3. **GDScript**; one file: `vn_bridge.gd`, reads viseme frames off
  `set_program_variable`, writes SOMA facial-action weights onto the
  ANNY rig, publishes SubViewport texture bytes back.
4. **C++**; none new. The bus NIF from `taskweft-nmm-personas`
  handles iox2.

Stdio JSON is blocklisted as an Elixir<->Python wire.

## Frame protocol on the WebSocket

Text frames upstream (browser -> server): `{"prompt":"...","persona":"s0042"}`.

Binary frames downstream (server -> browser), one per Godot frame:

    magic  u32 = 0x56 4E 41 56  ("VNAV")
    kind   u8  = 1 image, 2 audio, 3 text, 4 done
    ts     u64 microseconds since session start
    len    u32 payload bytes
    payload len bytes

Image frames carry a WebP-encoded 1024x1024 render of the SubViewport.
Audio frames carry Opus-encoded 20 ms Qwen3-TTS-12Hz output (RFD 1170).
Text frames carry the current dialog line (redundant with audio, for
captioning). Done frames end a turn.

## SpeakingFaces -> vn-avatar-personas construction

Per RFD 1173 §"The undivided unit: 1 SpeakingFaces trial":

    for subject in issai/Speaking_Faces subjects:
      pick a representative frame
      fit ANNY canonical rig via AnnyInverter + LBFGS polish
      save soma bones (78 * 3 rot + 3 root translation, float64)
      derive voice-clone conditioning tokens from a 5s audio clip
      pair with a persona .grafcet.jsonld (hand-authored per subject
        for the MVP; later, generated from the transcript vocabulary)

Row shape:

| column | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | subject id (SpeakingFaces "s0001".."s0142") |
| anny_identity | list[float] | ANNY identity params |
| soma_pose | list[float] | 78x3 + 3, canonical neutral |
| voice_tokens | list[int] | Qwen3-TTS-12Hz CustomVoice conditioning (RFD 1170) |
| persona_grafcet | string | path into the same repo |
| license | string | CC-BY-4.0 attribution to issai/Speaking_Faces |

## Trace row shape (mirrors MaskScore §8-stub schema)

Each VN turn produces one row per modality (text, audio, video):

| column | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | session_id + turn_index |
| instruction | string | player's prompt |
| persona | string | subject id |
| output_text | string | Qwen3-VL line |
| output_audio | string | .opus path |
| output_video | string | .webp sequence path |
| scores | list[float] | reward-model score per dimension |
| task_type | string | dialog_reply | scene_transition | expression_change |
| dimension | string | instruction_following | consistency | overall |

    #    Asserts: WebSocket receives >=1 image frame + >=1 audio frame,
    #    trace row lands with a non-nil reward-model score.

    # 6. COMMIT AND PUSH before tear down. Everything not in a git
    #    repo goes with the machine (CLAUDE.md).

    # 7. `vast destroy instance <id>` and double-check the console.

## MVP smoke, in one sentence

Player types "hello" into the browser, one WebSocket message goes
up, one Qwen3-VL line comes back, the anny-in-godot mouth moves,
the SubViewport streams five WebP frames, one MaskScore trace row
lands with `task_type = dialog_reply` and a non-nil reward-model
score, one `.usda` records the scene. Everything after that is
expansion.

## What is not here (deferred to follow-on RFDs)

1. Voice-in phase 2. Text-in is the MVP.
2. The full 142-subject corpus. MVP is 8.
3. 3D locations. MVP uses 2D Wan-VACE background stills.
4. The RL-train dataset construction. Bench + reward-train are the
  first two; RL-train follows once the reward model is on Hub.
5. The verifier RFD asserting our SpeechEditReward decode agrees
  with an independent lip-sync ground truth. That is the anti-
  entropy check the follow-on adds.
