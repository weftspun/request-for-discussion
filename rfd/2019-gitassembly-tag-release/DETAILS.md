## Context and problem statement

The `merge` repo's `gitassembly` recipe builds the engine by merging
feature branches (`feat/module-xr-grid`, `feat/module-cassie`,
`feat/module-http3`, and the rest) onto the frozen Godot 4.7 base. The
base is pinned, but the feature branch tips are not: an assembly run
today and one next week can merge different branch SHAs and produce a
different engine. The cold-boot dependencies refer to the branches by
name, so "assemble these branches" alone is not a reproducible
artifact. What is the shareable, fixed reference for the assembled
engine?

## Decision drivers

- Reproducibility: a name that resolves to one exact assembled tree,
  not moving tips.
- A single reference the demo, `godot-images`, and CI can all build
  from.
- Cheap to cut so releases keep pace with the feature branches.
- Do not steamroll prior assemblies that other work already builds
  against.

## Considered options

- Keep referring to branch names; each consumer assembles the tips
  itself.
- Force-push the assembled `multiplayer-fabric` branch as the shared
  reference.
- Push an immutable, timestamped tag of the assembled tree (the
  existing `merge` tooling already does this).

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: push an immutable, timestamped tag, because it gives
one reference that resolves to an exact tree without overwriting
prior assemblies. This adopts the behavior the `merge` tooling already
implements rather than inventing a new scheme.

- `elixir update_godot_v_sekai.exs` (run from `main`) fetches the
  remotes, runs the vendored `git-assembler` over the `gitassembly`
  recipe, then tags the assembled `multiplayer-fabric` branch and
  pushes only the tag to `v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/godot`. The
  moving branch stays local, so a release never steamrolls anyone
  working off a previous tip.
- Tag format (CalVer, UTC): `v<YYYY.MM.DD.HHMM>-multiplayer-fabric`.
  The timestamp is the only thing that changes between runs; the
  assembler is deterministic, so the same inputs produce the same
  tree.
- The current cold-boot reference is
  `v2026.06.06.1853-multiplayer-fabric` (commit `9ea526ab`), assembled
  onto the pinned 4.7 base with the full recipe, including
  `feat/module-xr-grid`, `feat/module-cassie`, and `feat/module-http3`.
- Consumers pin to a tag, not to branch names. `godot-images` builds
  its GHCR editor image from a tag, and the cold-boot steps reference
  that tag.
- Iterate with `--dry-run` (assembles locally, no push) before cutting
  a release.

## Consequences

- Good: a tag resolves to one exact assembled engine, so demo, image,
  and CI build the same tree.
- Good: tag-only push keeps every prior assembly intact and
  addressable.
- Bad: the CalVer tag carries no semantic version, so the assembled
  Godot version is implicit in the pinned base.
- Bad: tags must be cut deliberately, so a stale tag can lag the live
  branches.

## Confirmation

`git ls-remote --tags v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/godot` lists
`v<YYYY.MM.DD.HHMM>-multiplayer-fabric` tags, a `godot-images` build
from a tag reproduces the same editor, and the cold-boot steps
reference a tag rather than branch names.

## More information

The tag sits on top of the engine pin: the pin fixes the base, and the
tag fixes the assembly merged onto it. It is the reproducible artifact
the cold-boot dependencies build from. The tag format and workflow are
documented in the `merge` repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
