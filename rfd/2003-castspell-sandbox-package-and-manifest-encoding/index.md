## Problem

CastSpell's effect step needed a package format and a manifest
encoding, and no RFD fixed either one. Without a fixed format, each
effect step package could use a different, incompatible layout. The
design also needed a runtime FFI format between the host and a loaded
package, instead of adding a third, unrelated binary format.

## Decision

CastSpell's effect step ships as a single `.elf` file: an embedded,
static manifest inside the ELF, not a side-car file. The manifest
encodes as CBOR-LD, decoding to plain JSON-LD. The runtime FFI between
the host and a loaded package reuses the zone tick's own bitpacked
struct format, gated by an explicit ABI version field, not a third
binary format. `DETAILS.md` has the full reasoning, the library picks
(`jsonld-cpp` plus `QCBOR` for an offline authoring tool; `QCBOR` alone
inside the host, in pure C under Fil-C), and the rejected alternatives.
