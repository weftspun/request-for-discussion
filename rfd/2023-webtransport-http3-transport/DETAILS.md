## Context and problem statement

The stack needs a client/server transport that carries reliable
control messages and high-rate unreliable state over one connection,
on both native and web clients. Which transport does the engine
provide?

## Decision drivers

- Unreliable datagrams for high-rate state, plus reliable streams for
  control.
- One connection for both, with native and browser support.

## Considered options

- Standard `MultiplayerPeer` transports (ENet, WebSocket, WebRTC).
- WebTransport over HTTP/3 / QUIC.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: WebTransport over HTTP/3, provided by the engine's
`modules/http3` (on `feat/module-http3`):

- `quic_picoquic_backend.{cpp,h}` — native QUIC via picoquic.
- `quic_web_backend.cpp` + `quic_web_glue.js` — the web/wasm backend.
- `http3_client.{cpp,h}`, `quic_client.{cpp,h}`, `quic_server.h`.
- Classes `HTTP3Client`, `QUICClient`, `QUICServer`, `WebTransportPeer`.
- Demos: `modules/http3/demo/wt_client_test.gd`, `wt_server_demo.gd`,
  `wt_browser_test.html`.
- `lean/http3/PollingTermination.lean` proves the poll loop
  terminates.

One QUIC connection carries reliable streams and unreliable datagrams,
so control messages and high-rate state share a connection.

## Consequences

- Good: datagrams suit high-rate state; one connection serves native
  and browser.
- Bad: the fork carries a picoquic backend and a QUIC stack to
  maintain.

## Confirmation

The `modules/http3` demos open a WebTransport client and server over
QUIC.
