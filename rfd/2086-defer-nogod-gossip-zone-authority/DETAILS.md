## Context

`lean-rebac-core`'s `Rebac/core/NoGod.lean` (imported by `ReBAC.lean`)
is a proven, coordinator-free gossip protocol for zone-range
consensus: vector clocks (`VClock`), Hilbert-range containment
(`ZoneRange`, `geometricAuthority`, `geometricInterest`), a hybrid
logical clock (`HLC`), and theorems that gossip-based range adoption
preserves `DisjointRanges` — no two zones ever claim overlapping
authority — without a central coordinator.

## Why not now

`zone-server-h2o` today hardcodes `z_id = 0` in
`src/transport/webtransport_server.c` — it binds one UDP port and
services exactly one zone. There is no second zone to route between,
no gossip peer to exchange `ZoneRange` claims with, and no vector
clock needed to order events that, by construction, all originate
from the one process that has them. Porting the full
`VClock`/gossip/`HLC` system now would build structure for a need
that does not exist yet.

## What ports cleanly when multi-zone routing is real work

When a second zone exists, the reusable piece is narrow: `ZoneRange`
(a `{zoneId, lo, hi}` Hilbert-code interval) and `ZoneRange.contains`
/ `geometricAuthority` (find the zone whose range contains a given
Hilbert code) — about ten lines of pure C, directly portable the same
way `rebac.c` was. The gossip protocol (`NodeView`, `GossipMsg`,
`VClock.merge`, `HLC.advance`/`HLC.merge`) is what makes authority
assignment coordinator-free across multiple zone-server processes —
worth porting once there are multiple processes to coordinate, not
before.

## Revisit when

A second concurrently-running zone process exists (not just a second
`z_id` value handled by the same process). At that point, port
`ZoneRange`/`geometricAuthority` first (needed immediately), and the
gossip/`VClock`/`HLC` layer only once there is a real second process
to gossip with.
