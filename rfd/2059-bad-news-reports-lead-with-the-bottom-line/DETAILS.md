## Context and problem statement

A status report carries an outcome the reader acts on: a slipped date,
a broken build, a failed smoke. A report that opens with progress and
buffers the outcome to the end makes the reader scan for the catch
before the report says anything they can use. How does a report in
this project phrase an outcome the reader needs first?

## Decision drivers

- A reader who learns the outcome in the first sentence starts
  deciding on it immediately, rather than after a paragraph of
  buildup.
- An executive or on-call reader scans the opening line and stops; the
  rest is there for whoever needs the why.
- The rule stays mechanical enough to apply in review without debate.
- Urgency — a down service, a failed gate — leaves no room for a
  warm-up.

## Considered options

- Indirect approach: open with a progress buffer, then state the
  outcome.
- Direct approach (bottom line up front): state the outcome first,
  then the explanation, then the next step.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: "the direct approach", because the reader holds the
outcome before the explanation, so the explanation reads as context
rather than as suspense, and a reader who needs only the outcome stops
after one line.

A status report carries three parts in order:

1. The bottom line comes first. The opening sentence states the
   outcome plainly — the slip, the failure, the result — with no
   buffer, no apology, and no warm-up. A reader who reads only this
   line knows where the work stands.
2. The explanation follows. It gives the factual reason for the
   outcome; the reader already holds the result, so the explanation
   carries the why without holding it back.
3. The next step closes the report: the fix underway, the alternative
   open to the reader, or the time of the next update.

The voice rules out two habits:

- A progress buffer that opens on what went well and defers the
  outcome to the end.
- An apology or hedge in place of the outcome in the first sentence.

A good outcome takes the same shape: the first sentence states the
result, and the rest carries the why and the next step.

## Consequences

- Good, because the reader decides on the outcome from the first line
  instead of scanning for it.
- Good, because one shape covers a slip, a failed gate, and a shipped
  result alike.
- Good, because an urgent report — a down service, a recall — leads
  with the fact that drives the response.
- Bad, because the opening reads blunt, and an author used to a buffer
  needs practice to drop it.

## Confirmation

Review checks that a status report opens on its outcome, with the
explanation and the next step after it, and no progress buffer or
apology ahead of the bottom line.
