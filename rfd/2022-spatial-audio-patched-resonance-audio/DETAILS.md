## Context and problem statement

The zone server renders shared social-VR scenes where sound sources
need to be localized in 3D for every listener. Two things drive
presence: binaural HRTF rendering so a source is heard at the correct
azimuth and elevation over headphones, and audio probes that capture
how a room colors and occludes sound so a source baked behind a wall
does not leak through it. Godot's built-in `AudioServer` does stereo
panning and attenuation, but it has no HRTF path and no probe-based
spatialization. How should the engine produce HRTF spatial audio with
environmental probes?

## Decision drivers

- Binaural HRTF output for headphone VR.
- Audio probes for environmental response and occlusion, bakeable per
  scene.
- Double-precision engine build; the audio module has to link into the
  fork.
- Reuse a proven spatialization library rather than writing one.

## Considered options

- Godot built-in `AudioServer` panning only.
- Steam Audio (Valve) integration.
- A patched Resonance Audio integrated as an engine module plus a
  spatial-audio server.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: a patched Resonance Audio integrated as an engine
module, because it provides HRTF binaural rendering and ambisonic room
response with an open-source base the fork can carry, and it slots
into the engine as a module rather than a runtime GDExtension.

The implementation lives on two engine feature branches:

- `feat/module-resonance-audio` — the patched Resonance Audio vendored
  as an engine module, exposing HRTF binaural rendering and audio
  probes.
- `feat/spatial-audio-server` — the spatial-audio server that drives
  the module, placing sources and listeners and resolving probes per
  frame.

`sponza-godot-audio` (v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric) is the demo and
benchmark scene.

## Consequences

- Good: headphone listeners get correct HRTF localization, and probes
  give rooms a consistent response with occlusion.
- Good: the module links into the double-precision fork and ships with
  the engine assembly.
- Neutral: the fork carries a patch set against Resonance Audio, but
  the rebase burden is low. Upstream is abandoned (Google archived the
  project), so there are no upstream changes to track, and the engine
  is pinned to a frozen Godot 4.7 commit, so the module does not chase
  engine movement. The fork owns the code.
- Bad: HRTF and probe resolution add per-frame audio cost that the
  spatial-audio server has to budget.

## Confirmation

The two branches assemble into the engine and the `sponza-godot-audio`
scene renders HRTF output with probes. The capability is tracked in
the repository-and-capability-inventory capabilities table.

## More information

Resonance Audio is Google's open-source spatial audio SDK
(<https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/>), now archived
and no longer maintained upstream, so the fork is the de facto source.
"Patched" here means the fork carries local changes to build it as an
engine module and to wire its HRTF and probe paths to the
spatial-audio server. The engine itself is pinned to a frozen Godot
4.7 commit, so the module targets a fixed engine API.
