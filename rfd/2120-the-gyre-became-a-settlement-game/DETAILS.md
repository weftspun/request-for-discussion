## What changed, line by line

|            | RFD 2085                          | `service-store`                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| The player | A Spark taking contracts          | The Queen, commissioning venues                 |
| The loop   | Hub, field, return                | Commission, then wait a cycle                   |
| The map    | Six zones to travel               | Six venues on two decks                         |
| Contracts  | Taken by the player               | Chosen by Sparks, resolved against risk         |
| Currency   | Chits                             | Scrip                                           |
| Antagonist | Overseer Q-11                     | The Debt Clock, compounding one percent a cycle |
| Combat     | One of nine, avoidable            | One of nine, avoidable                          |
| Failure    | Death, and a dropped Memory Drive | Wear, capped, and a Frame that stops earning    |

The last two rows are what survived intact.

## The venues, and what each one does

| Venue                | Cost | Effect                                        |
| -------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Cycle's End Tavern   | 120  | Rest, so a Spark takes longer odds            |
| Splicer's Den        | 200  | Frames repaired, so wear stops ending careers |
| Transit Rails        | 260  | More contracts reach the board                |
| Exchange Plaza       | 340  | Salvage sells for what it is worth            |
| Chapel of the Backup | 420  | A failure costs a cycle rather than a Spark   |
| Broadcast Row        | 500  | Word gets out, and Sparks arrive              |

A venue changes behaviour rather than adding a number. The Tavern and the Chapel raise the nerve a Spark brings to a
contract, the Den takes wear back faster than rest does, the Rails widen the board, and the Row is the only source of
new Sparks. Each is a decision about what kind of ward this becomes.

## The numbers the ward holds

A ward starts with a treasury of 300 against a debt of 4000. Debt compounds at one percent a cycle, and what the
treasury can spare pays it down and counts as retired. A contract that succeeds pays its posted amount, and that is
the only event that issues scrip.

Wear rises by 2 on a success and 5 on a failure, falls by 1 for the cycle's rest, falls a further 4 where the Den
stands, and is held between 0 and 90. Nerve is 100 less wear, plus 25 with the Tavern and 20 with the Chapel. A Spark
with no nerve for anything on the board stands idle.

Somebody hears the Broadcast Row every 12 cycles. The arrival counts cycles rather than drawing, so a replay puts the
newcomer in the same place.

A ward holds at most 48 Sparks, because a subscriber's slice holds 64 entities and the venues, the Queen and a full
board come out of that budget first. A larger ward is refused, and a game past that size is more than one ward, to a
limit of eight.

## Why the shape changed

The comment at the top of `src/queen.c` gives the reason directly. A settlement game is a state machine over days with
nothing in the critical path to draw, which makes it the one game shape genuinely better as a database than as an
engine. The Queen commissions and waits, so a cycle is a transaction and the whole of the visible state is a query.

The MUD shape needed a room, a description, and a player standing in it, none of which a store plane exercises. The
settlement shape gave `service-store` a workload that is exactly the thing the store plane claims to be good at:
N Sparks is N databases committing every cycle, and paying one is a transfer between two of them under the parallel
commit protocol.

## What this leaves open

Whether the Spark-facing game returns. Nothing here forecloses it, and RFD 2119 assumes it does, with hands and
salvage in a headset. The ward would be the economy underneath it rather than the whole of it.

Whether Memory Drives arrive with that, since they are the one adversarial interaction the setting describes and the
one object whose duplication is unsurvivable in the fiction.

Whether the absent zones come back as places, given that venues, Sparks and contracts already carry coordinates in
micrometres for the interest filter.

## What has not been built

The Reclamation Wards, the Tangle, the Sub-Net and the Underhull have no representation in the ward. Splicer Jax,
Overseer Q-11 and Rook are absent, though the Splicer's Den carries Jax's role as a venue. Memory Drives, and the
looting and ransoming of them, are unimplemented, which matters because they are the setting's one adversarial
interaction and RFD 2119 turns on them.

These stay in 0085 as setting. This RFD narrows what `service-store` claims to simulate rather than retiring
the fiction around it.

## Consequences

0085 remains the setting record and stops being the design record for the ward. A reader who wants to know what the
simulation does reads this one.

The salvage and interaction model in RFD 2119 sits on the cycle boundary rather than on a Hub and Field loop, because
the loop it was written against is not the loop that exists.
