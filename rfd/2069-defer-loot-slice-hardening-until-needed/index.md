rfd: "2069"
state: published
scope: loot-action vertical slice deferred hardening scope
---

## Problem

The loot-action vertical slice's decided scope goes beyond its stated
goal, a slice complete enough to exercise every integration seam. The
running `godot-loop-slice` already meets that integration goal. The
rest of the decided scope risks conflating the shipped deliverable
with pending work, and building structure ahead of a demonstrated
need.

## Decision

The loot-action vertical slice's decided scope goes beyond its stated
goal — a slice complete enough to exercise every integration seam.
The running `godot-loop-slice` already carries the loop end to end and
the playable-loop smoke passes, so the integration goal is met. The
rest of the decided scope — a separate presence reducer, a separate
progression reducer, the budgeter core, the CockroachDB adapter, the
measured 90 Hz performance gate, and a real OpenXR build — carries
forward as deferred-until-needed. Each deferred item pairs with the
concrete trigger that revives it; the team builds an item only when
its trigger fires, not before. This avoids conflating the shipped
deliverable with pending work, and avoids building structure ahead of
a demonstrated need.
