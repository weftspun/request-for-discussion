## Context and problem statement

The fabric has transport, authority, persistence, and budget decisions
in place, but no running loop that exercises all of them together.
The team needs a first playable to find the gaps that only appear
when the whole stack runs end to end: a social hub where players
gather, an instanced combat zone where they fight and collect, and
the round trip that carries the result back. Without a bounded target
the risk is that each layer is individually correct but the
integration is never tested until it is too late to fix.

There is no single bounded deliverable that tells the team whether
the stack works together. The team needs one vertical slice, small
enough to build in a week, complete enough to exercise every
integration seam: transport, server authority, loot contention,
inventory persistence, performance budgeting, and the
Hub-to-Field-to-Hub round trip.

## Design

Ship one vertical slice of an instanced, four-player loot-action core
loop.

**Scene layout**

- One Hub deck with a shop backed by the loot and progression cores.
  The shop degrades to a free starting kit if the economy slips.
- One Field room: four players, one melee combo against one enemy,
  one loot drop, one persistence round trip.

**Loop**

1. Players gather in the Hub and form a party.
2. The party teleports into the Field instance hosted by
   `zone-server`.
3. One player lands a timed melee combo. The server validates the
   hit, deducts enemy health, and spawns a loot drop.
4. One player touches the drop first. The loot core resolves
   contention by receipt timestamp, grants the winner, and rejects
   the rest.
5. The progression core commits the inventory delta through the
   CockroachDB adapter (or the SQLite fallback if the commit path
   slips).
6. The party teleports back to the Hub. The shop reflects the new
   inventory.

**Cores**

Each concern is a hexagonal pure reducer:

| Core        | Responsibility                                           | Key ports                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Combat      | Combo timing, hit validation, health, enemy spawn window | `input_source`, `tick_source`, `behavior_source` → `state_sink`, `event_sink` |
| Loot        | Drop generation, first-touch contention                  | `loot_request_source` → `grant_sink`, `inventory_delta_sink`                  |
| Presence    | Remote-pose interpolation                                | `pose_source` → `avatar_sink`                                                 |
| Progression | Profile, inventory, affinity gate                        | `profile_source` → `commit_sink`                                              |
| Budgeter    | Per-frame quality knobs under load                       | `measurement_source` → `knob_sink`                                            |

**Authority and networking**

The `zone-server` is the single authority per instance. For the
deadline the model is server-authoritative with client interpolation
and no prediction. The rollback adapter lands after the gate behind
the same ports.

**Content and performance gate**

Content is first-party curated only; the `zone-baker` enforces hard
budgets at bake time. The sign-off gate is a SteamVR build at 90 Hz:
four avatars and one Field room under 500,000 visible triangles and
200 draw calls per eye.

**What ships after the gate**

Ranged and caster archetypes, Steam Frame and Steam Deck builds,
in-headset authoring, rollback, and user-generated content.

## Downsides

- The slice runs on placeholder content; art is not gated, only the
  frame floor.
- Only the melee archetype ships; ranged and caster are explicitly
  deferred.
- No client prediction at the deadline; the rollback adapter lands
  after the gate.
- The SQLite fallback in progression degrades the inventory
  persistence, which is not visible to the player but makes the
  economy untrustworthy until the CockroachDB path is confirmed.

## Rejected alternatives

- Full toolchain and content pipeline first: building the pipeline
  before the loop pushes the integration gaps late, when they are
  most expensive. Rejected for the thin steel thread.
- Multi-archetype slice: ranged and caster widen scope beyond one
  week. Melee alone proves combat authority and loot contention; the
  others follow the gate.
- Broader platform launch: SteamVR is sufficient scope for the slice;
  Steam Frame and Steam Deck follow.
- Per-zone distributed authority (Maglev intercept model): a
  geometric Hilbert-zone authority was attempted and rejected in the
  Maglev smoke test. One `zone-server` per instance is simpler and
  sufficient for a four-player room.

## Confirmation

The slice's stated goal — exercise every integration seam — is met.
On 2026-06-29 the playable-loop smoke (`smoke.sh`) runs end to end on
the frozen Godot 4.7 double editor and passes: one authoritative
server and four bot clients carry the Hub-to-Field-to-Hub round trip
through transport, server authority, loot contention, and
SQLite-backed inventory persistence. The run grants exactly one bot
and commits exactly one profile row; the smoke asserts both — exactly
one grant and exactly one committed row — and exits zero.

The integration is proven. The decided scope that is not built is
production hardening and platform reach, which adds no integration
coverage. As built on 2026-06-29, verified by reading the
`godot-loop-slice` source:

- Two of the five cores exist as named pure resolvers wired into the
  server: combat (`core/combat.gd`) and loot (`core/loot.gd`).
  Presence runs through a Hilbert interest core (`core/hilbert.gd`)
  and a multiplayer sink (`adapters/multiplayer_sink.gd`) rather than
  a named presence core. Progression is an inline inventory append
  committed through a SQLite adapter (`adapters/sqlite_profiles.gd`)
  rather than a separate reducer. The budgeter core is not
  implemented.
- Persistence is SQLite. The CockroachDB adapter is not implemented.
- The performance gate (90 Hz, 500,000 triangles, 200 draw calls per
  eye) is not measured or enforced in the repository.
- The `OpenXR` desktop export preset duplicates the Windows Desktop
  preset and carries no XR options; the Quest Android preset is the
  configured XR target.

These decided-but-unbuilt items — the three cores as separate
reducers, the CockroachDB adapter, the performance gate, and a real
OpenXR build — carry forward as deferred-until-needed in
`decisions/20260629-defer-loot-slice-hardening-until-needed.md`.
