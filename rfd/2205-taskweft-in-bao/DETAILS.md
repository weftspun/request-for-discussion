# RFD 2205: Taskweft in Bao — details

## Plugin binary — `bao-plugin-taskweft`

New Go project at `7-service/service-taskweft-bao/`. Layout mirrors
the shipped `7-service/service-bao-sqlite-fdb/` reference plugin:

    service-taskweft-bao/
      main.go               # plugin.ServeMultiplex entrypoint
      backend/
        backend.go          # Factory → framework.Backend
        paths.go            # taskweft/{config,roles,creds,skip}/…
        rebac_check.go      # Bao capability lookup via req identity
      planner/
        shim.h              # extern "C" — one entry per FINE_NIF
        shim.cpp            # includes standalone/*.hpp, drops fine glue
        planner.go          # cgo bindings, ~600 LOC
      Makefile              # builds libtaskweft.a from standalone/
      README.md

Sizing from the standalone-header audit (2026-09-05): **~400 LOC
shim C++ + ~600 LOC Go bindings + build glue**, ~3–5 days to a
green pilot. Adds `clang` to the Bao container build (already
present for FDB's C client) and a static `libtaskweft.a` linked
into the plugin binary.

## Plugin type declaration

Registered as a **database** plugin (`bao plugin register database
taskweft`), not a secrets engine. The database type gives us Bao's
native lease lifecycle — Initialize / New / Update / Delete
callbacks with no bookkeeping of our own. Mapping RECTGTN onto the
database-plugin vocabulary:

| Bao database | RECTGTN |
|---|---|
| Database | Fleet domain (one per mount) |
| Role | Goal id (`motionbricks`, `escort-refugee-ship`) |
| Credentials read | Pick a Task for the caller |
| New user response | `{"task":[<action>, <actor>, …]}` + lease |
| Delete-on-revoke | Undo assignment state (release GPU claim, …) |
| Update | Renew a running task's lease (heartbeat) |

If the database-plugin interface's `NewUserResponse{Username string}`
field proves too narrow for the task-JSON payload, the fallback is
a **secrets engine plugin with `framework.Secret`** — same lease
semantics, JSON-shaped responses natively supported. Either way
the planner code path is identical; only the SDK-facing shims
differ. The pilot will tell us which fits.

## Paths

Four Bao-native paths, database-plugin convention:

    taskweft/config/<name>      # Configure — points at fleet.sqlite
    taskweft/roles/<goal_id>    # Role — declare an issuable Goal
    taskweft/creds/<goal_id>    # NewUser — the pick call
    taskweft/skip/<task_key>    # UpdateUser / sibling — skip-write

### `taskweft/creds/<goal_id>` (the pick)

1. Read the fleet domain SQLite database via the sibling sqlite-fdb
   secrets engine at `secret/taskweft/db/fleet`.
2. Select current skip-state rows from the `skip` table.
3. Marshal both to JSON; call `tw_plan(domain_json, skip_json)` on
   the cgo-linked planner.
4. Filter the returned steps by `actor == <caller cn>`.
5. Return the first match as a `NewUserResponse` (or
   `logical.Response{Secret: ...}` in the fallback shape) with
   `lease_duration = duration_of(action)`.

Bao stamps the response `lease_id` on the server clock; every peer's
`expires_at` derives from one wall-clock reading — operator's
global-time argument, satisfied by construction.

### `taskweft/skip/<task_key>`

Inserts `(task_key, method_idx, cn, at)` into the skip table. The
next `creds` read substitutes it into the domain's `todo_list`
before planning, so the planner backjumps to
`nearest_retryable_ancestor` (see `tw_soltree.hpp`) without a
planner-side extension.

### Lease Revoke (`DeleteUser`)

Undoes any state the pick wrote — releases GPU claims, decrements
progress-track marks, clears `/gpu_claim/gpu-3090`. A peer that
crashes without renewing its lease has its assignment reclaimed by
Bao automatically. No bespoke reaper.

## ReBAC gating

The plugin runs `may-use--<device>` checks BEFORE calling the
planner, using Bao's own `system.Client.Sys().Capabilities` against
the request's authenticated identity. A caller whose group lacks
the capability gets `403` from Bao and the cgo hop never runs.
"Documentary → enforced" in one plugin — the compute-lease broker
RFD 2202 named as future work.

## Storage — SQLite, not KV

The git-tracked file
`2-contract/manuals-weftspun/rectgtn/fleet.jsonld` remains the
human-editable source of truth for the domain document. A small
builder script `scripts/build_fleet_sqlite.py` compiles it into
`2-contract/manuals-weftspun/rectgtn/fleet.sqlite` (also checked
into git — a small binary fixture, same pattern as
`service-sqlar-cas/docs/fixtures/persona.sqlite`).

CI on manuals-weftspun runs `bao kv put secret/taskweft/db/fleet
@rectgtn/fleet.sqlite` on any commit that changes the sqlite blob.
The diffable JSON-LD is what humans review. `sync_fleet_domain.py`
(already shipped) still reconciles capability edges from Bao's own
`relationships/*--<verb>--*` tuples into the JSON-LD before the
sqlite mirror step.

Schema — three tables, ETNF-shaped for local SQLite work (per
CLAUDE.md's carve-out: HF datasets denormalize, local SQLite stays
ETNF):

    CREATE TABLE domain (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      jsonld BLOB NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE skip (
      task_key   TEXT    NOT NULL,
      method_idx INTEGER NOT NULL,
      cn         TEXT    NOT NULL,
      at         INTEGER NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (task_key, method_idx)
    );

    CREATE TABLE assign (
      lease_id   TEXT    PRIMARY KEY,
      cn         TEXT    NOT NULL,
      action     TEXT    NOT NULL,
      expires_at INTEGER NOT NULL
    );

## WASM parity target

The same `standalone/*.hpp` compiles via emcc to WebAssembly with
zero source changes. Parallel build at
`3-interactor/taskweft/wasm/`:

    build.sh              # emcc invocation
    taskweft-shim.cpp     # same shim as the cgo plugin
    → taskweft.wasm       # output
    → taskweft.js         # small JS loader

The browser demo already shipping in
`7-service/service-sqlar-cas/docs/` (`sql-wasm.js` + Range-fetch
`persona.sqlite`) loads `taskweft.wasm` alongside and calls
`plan(domainJson, skipJson)` on it. See RFD 2204's Starforged demo
section for the game-loop shape.

Parity is a hard verification target — same domain + same skip
state → byte-for-byte identical plan JSON in both hosts. Recorded
as a fixture under `test/parity/` that both harnesses read.

## Deploy gap — three edits, none built today

1. `7-service/service-openbao/Dockerfile.fdb` — `COPY
   bao-plugin-taskweft /bao/plugins/`.
2. `7-service/service-openbao/config-fdb.hcl` — add
   `plugin_directory = "/bao/plugins"`.
3. `7-service/service-openbao/entrypoint-fdb.sh` — one-shot init:

        CHECKSUM=$(sha256sum /bao/plugins/bao-plugin-taskweft | cut -d' ' -f1)
        bao plugin register -sha256=$CHECKSUM database taskweft
        bao secrets enable -path=taskweft taskweft

Same shape `service-bao-sqlite-fdb`'s README documents. The
existing weftspun-bao deploy loads zero plugins today (both HCLs
have no `plugin_directory`, entrypoint has no `bao plugin
register` step); this RFD closes that gap.

## Pilot — three phases

**Phase 1 — local Bao plugin**. Build the plugin binary (cgo-linked,
static `libtaskweft.a`); register against a `bao dev` server; mount
as `taskweft/`; fleet.sqlite loaded from disk via the sibling
sqlite-fdb secrets engine. Assert:

1. `bao read taskweft/creds/motionbricks` (auth: HERO's cert)
   returns `{"task":["extract-safetensors","hero.<cn>","motionbricks"],
   "lease_id":..., "lease_duration": 2700}` (PT45M).
2. `bao write taskweft/skip/train-qat method_idx=0`; then
   `bao read taskweft/creds/motionbricks` returns
   `["update-config-pins", ...]` from `use_aero_ex_configs` — the
   backjump.
3. Two `bao read` calls one second apart, one from HERO one from
   ANCHOR, both against a Goal both are eligible for, see
   `lease_id`s stamped by the same server clock and disjoint task
   assignments (planner determinism).
4. Lease expiry: `bao lease revoke <lease_id>` triggers
   `DeleteUser`; assert the SQLite `assign` row is gone and any
   state var the pick wrote is undone.

**Phase 2 — WASM parity**. Emcc-build `taskweft.wasm` from the same
standalone headers. Extend the browser demo to fetch fleet.sqlite
via `Range: bytes=0-` and call `taskweft.wasm`'s
`plan(domainJson, skipJson)`. Assert byte-identical output vs
phase-1 step 1 for the same input. Playwright at
`scratchpad/pages_check.mjs` verifies.

**Phase 3 — production deploy**. Land the three deploy-gap edits;
push weftspun-bao; smoke-test phase-1 assertions against the
deployed instance with real peer certs.

## Verification

- **Global-time correctness**: two peers, same read, `lease_id`
  stamped by one wall-clock. Recorded in a measurement section
  appended to this RFD after phase 1 lands.
- **ReBAC enforcement**: a peer without `may-use--gpu` on
  `gpu-3090` gets `403` from `bao read taskweft/creds/motionbricks`
  and the planner never runs. Test asserts the cgo hop never
  executed (log absence).
- **Backjumping**: a `skip` write moves the winning task to the
  next method's first action; a second skip (same task, `method_idx
  + 1`) moves it further. Reuses `tw_soltree.hpp`'s
  `nearest_retryable_ancestor` verbatim.
- **Cgo boundary safety**: valgrind / asan on the plugin binary
  linked against `libtaskweft.a`; assert no leaks across 1000 plan
  calls. Negative control (rule 2): intentionally-malformed domain
  JSON produces a Bao error, not a segfault.
- **WASM / plugin parity**: same domain + same skip state → same
  plan JSON in both hosts, byte-for-byte. Recorded as a fixture
  under `test/parity/` that both harnesses read.
- **Blast-radius awareness** (RFD 2147): a plugin crash restarts
  the subprocess without taking Bao down (Bao's plugin process
  model); a planner-domain load failure returns `500` from `creds`
  reads, and the peer falls back to the pre-plugin ad-hoc
  coordination. Documented here as "graceful degrade".
- **Browser-reviewable**: reviewers open GitHub Pages, load
  `fleet.sqlite`, and see the planner's sol-tree rendered
  client-side. No Bao, no toolchain.
- **Negative control** (rule 2): a planted broken domain (missing
  capability edge) returns "no assignable Task" for every peer with
  a specific error code, rather than silently returning the first
  step of a stale plan.

## Future work

- **Pure-Go port of the planner** — sized at ~7000 LOC / 8–12
  weeks in the standalone-header audit. The plugin's Go API stays
  stable across the swap; callers see no change. Trigger: when the
  plugin's cgo hop shows up as a hot path in tracing, or when the
  Bao container's clang dependency becomes a supply-chain concern.
- **Starforged domain** (RFD 2204 test-vector corpus) — a second
  domain loaded into the same plugin, exercising deeper method
  alternatives and stochastic move outcomes. Drives the VRM demo's
  decision-point control surface.
