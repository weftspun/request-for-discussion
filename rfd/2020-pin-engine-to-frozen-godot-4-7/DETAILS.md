## Context and problem statement

The engine fork carries many feature branches (cassie, resonance
audio, native media, speech, spatial audio, the fabric modules) that
the `merge` recipe assembles onto a base. If that base tracks a moving
upstream, every assembly can shift under the patches, so a green build
one day can break the next from upstream churn alone. What base should
the feature branches and the assembly build on?

## Decision drivers

- A stable base so assembly and CI are reproducible.
- Patch branches that do not have to chase upstream API changes
  mid-cycle.
- A known engine version for the docs and for downstream images.

## Considered options

- Track upstream `godotengine/godot` `master`.
- Track an upstream release branch.
- Pin the fork's `master` to one frozen upstream Godot 4.7 commit.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: pin the fork's `master` to one frozen upstream Godot
4.7 commit, because it gives the patch branches and the assembly a
fixed target, so builds are reproducible and upstream churn cannot
break an assembly.

- The fork's `master` is the frozen base. Its tip is `8a337510` (Godot
  `4.7.0-beta`, per `version.py`).
- Every feature branch in the `merge` `gitassembly` recipe stands
  alone on `master`; the recipe merges them onto the assembled branch
  from that base.
- The pin moves only by a deliberate update to `master`, not by
  following upstream.

## Consequences

- Good: assemblies and CI are reproducible against a fixed engine.
- Good: feature branches target one fixed engine API.
- Bad: upstream fixes after the pin are not picked up until `master`
  is advanced on purpose.
- Bad: the longer the pin sits on a beta, the larger the eventual
  catch-up to a later 4.7.

## Confirmation

`version.py` on the fork reports `4.7.0-beta`, and the `gitassembly`
recipe bases its branches on `master`. Advancing the engine is a
single, reviewable change to the `master` pin.

## More information

This pin is why the spatial audio decision notes the module targets a
fixed engine API. The exact upstream commit that `master` mirrors
lives in the godot fork's git history.
