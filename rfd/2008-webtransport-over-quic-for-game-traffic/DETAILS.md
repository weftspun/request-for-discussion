## Context

The zone server needs low-latency bidirectional communication between
clients and the Godot game server. HTTP/1.1 and WebSocket both run over
TCP, which head-of-line blocks on packet loss and degrades real-time
game state.

## Consequences

- UDP eliminates TCP head-of-line blocking.
- Fly.io passes UDP without DNAT, so the app must bind to the same port
  clients connect to.
- Port 443 requires running as root (or `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`). The
  gateway container runs as root.
- Datagrams are used for game state messages. Streams are avoided for
  ping/pong to sidestep stream half-close deadlock (client must close
  write side before server response fires).
- Cloudflare's proxy cannot forward QUIC/UDP. All game-traffic DNS
  records must be DNS-only (no proxy).
