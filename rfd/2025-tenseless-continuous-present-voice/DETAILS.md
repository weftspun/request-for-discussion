## Context and problem statement

Comments and documentation drift out of sync with code as the system
changes. A comment written as history ("added a cache", "we removed
the old path") or as a plan ("will solve this", "TODO: wire X")
describes a moment that has passed or has not yet arrived, so a reader
cannot check it against the code in front of them. How should prose in
this repo phrase what it says about the system?

## Decision drivers

- A reader trusts a comment when it matches the code as it stands.
- History lives in git; plans live in issues and decision records.
- The rule stays mechanical enough to apply in review without debate.

## Considered options

- Free choice of tense per author.
- Past-tense changelog voice inside code comments.
- A tenseless continuous-present voice where every sentence states
  what is currently true of the system.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: a tenseless continuous-present voice, because a
sentence that states a present truth stays correct as long as the code
it describes stays the same, and goes stale visibly the moment the
code changes.

Every comment and documentation sentence states what is currently true
of the system. Prose describes behaviour ("the parser streams
tokens"), and an unfinished area reads as a present gap ("the parser
handles no Unicode escapes yet") rather than as a task or a past edit.
The voice covers code comments, doc pages, and decision records alike.

The voice rules out three habits:

- Past-tense narration of edits, such as "removed the legacy path" or
  "we switched to a queue".
- Future or imperative planning, such as "will add validation" or
  "TODO: handle retries".
- Temporal qualifiers that age, such as "now", "currently changed", or
  "previously".

A TODO document states each open item as a present gap, so the file
reads as a description of where the system stands rather than a
logbook of intentions.

## Consequences

- Good, because a stale sentence signals a real divergence from the
  code, which makes review catch it.
- Good, because one voice covers code comments, doc pages, and
  decision records.
- Bad, because a present-gap phrasing reads less naturally than an
  imperative TODO, and authors need practice to phrase work that way.

## Confirmation

Review checks that new comments and prose state present truths, with
no past-tense edit narration, no future or imperative planning, and no
aging temporal qualifiers. The existing decision records in this repo
already read this way.

## More information

This generalizes the house rule applied across the sinew Lean spec and
its native viewer prose, where comments describe current behaviour and
`todo.md` lists each open item as a present gap.
