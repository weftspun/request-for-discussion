## Context and problem statement

The hexagonal cores (`rfd/2028-hexagonal-core-ports-adapters`) hold
dependency-free domain logic that Godot, the Elixir backend, and a CLI
all bind. The team wants strong spec and proof guarantees on that
logic without linking a heavy language runtime into every host. The
`idtx-flow` repository already explores this shape in its
`LEAN_KERNELS_HOST_ADAPTERS` investigation.

## Considered options

- Link the Lean runtime into each host and call exported Lean
  functions over a C ABI.
- Hand-write the cores in flat C with no Lean involvement.
- Use Lean 4 at build time for the spec and code generation, and ship
  a flat-C runtime core.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: use Lean 4 at build time as the kernel, the spec, and
the code generator, and ship each runtime core as a flat C ABI behind
the port ring with no Lean runtime linked into any host, because this
keeps the proof leverage while the hosts bind only a flat C surface.
The first option links a heavy runtime and marshals Lean objects
across every boundary; the second option loses the spec and proof
leverage.

Each core models a pure reducer over byte-serialized state, so it is
bytes to bytes. The compute kernels are authored in Lean and lowered
to Slang through
[lean-slang](https://github.com/V-Sekai-fire/lean-slang), then
`slangc -target spirv` lowers the Slang to SPIR-V, and the runtime
core dispatches the `.spv` compute kernel behind the flat C ABI,
byte-pinned beside the core (`rfd/2032-core-codegen-lean-slang`). The
spec suite drives the C ABI through Python ctypes, the property tests
run on Plausible, and a handful of theorems pin the invariants that
never break. This mirrors `idtx-flow`, where `flow/core` compiles to a
flat-C library, `flow/ports` is the flat C ABI, and `flow/core/spec`
drives that ABI through ctypes with no engine and no hardware.

## Consequences

- A host binds only the flat C ABI and never sees core internals or a
  Lean runtime.
- CI runs the cores headless on the workstation, with no engine and no
  device.
- Lean stays a build-time tool, so the runtime carries no Lean
  dependency.

## Confirmation

Each core passes its ctypes fixture suite and its Plausible properties
in CI, and no host binary links a Lean runtime.
