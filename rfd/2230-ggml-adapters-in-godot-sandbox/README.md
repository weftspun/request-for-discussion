# RFD 2230: ggml model adapters as sandboxed GDScript over one native module

**State:** discussion
**Flight level:** L2 (coordination — collapses N per-model C++
modules into 1 shared native + N GDScript adapters)
**Feature:** ggml lives as a single native module inside
`entities-godot-sandbox`; model-specific adapter code (tokenizer,
prompt templates, LoRA scaling, sampler config, per-model quirks)
moves out of per-project C++ into GDScript loaded at runtime with
sandbox permissions
**Scope:** `entities-godot-sandbox/modules/ggml/` (new), motion-
bricks-cpp / kimodo / skin-tokens-cpp adapter code, RFD 2212
(motion-bricks-as-native-module rescopes), RFD 2229 (this is one
of its named consolidations landing)

## Operator directive

Operator, 2026-09-05, verbatim: *"Are you able to move the ggml
model adapters and process from c++ to godot-sandbox gdscript
if we add ggml to entities-godot?"*.

**Answer:** yes, cleanly, with a native/adapter split. The
precondition — adding ggml as a shared module under
`entities-godot-sandbox` — is exactly the shape RFD 2229's
interchangeable-parts policy asks for: one ggml surface every
consumer links, not N per-project C++ modules.

## The layering

**Layer 1 — native, one module.** `entities-godot-sandbox/modules/ggml/`
hosts `2-contract/ggml/` (RFD 2188 canonical source) plus ggml's
Vulkan backend (MoltenVK on macOS). Exposes a small GDExtension
surface, GDScript-callable:

```gdscript
var model := Ggml.load_model("res://models/motion-bricks.gguf")
var lora := Ggml.load_lora("res://models/motion-bricks-walk.lora")
model.apply_lora(lora)
var tokens := Ggml.tokenize("walk forward 60 frames")
var out := model.run_inference(tokens, {"max_new_tokens": 60})
```

The native module handles: model file mmap, KV cache, backend
dispatch (CPU / Metal / Vulkan / WebGPU), sampler primitives,
tensor arithmetic. Nothing about a specific model's chat template
or LoRA layout lives here.

**Layer 2 — GDScript, per-model adapters.** One `.gd` file per
model. Each adapter is a Resource subclass extending
`GgmlAdapter`:

```gdscript
# res://adapters/motion_bricks.gd
class_name MotionBricksAdapter extends GgmlAdapter

const MODEL_PATH := "res://models/motion-bricks.gguf"
const TOKENIZER := "sentencepiece-motion"

func format_prompt(motion_desc: String, frames: int) -> String:
    return "<motion>%s</motion><frames>%d</frames>" % [motion_desc, frames]

func decode_output(tokens: PackedInt32Array) -> Array:
    # motion-bricks specific: tokens -> pose keyframes
    ...
```

Adapters run under Godot's script permission system + the
existing `modules/sandbox/` capabilities: an adapter loaded at
runtime from disk (or from the SQLite model bundle per RFD 2214)
cannot escape the GDScript sandbox, cannot open arbitrary files,
cannot spawn processes. Same shape RFD 2213 relies on for VRM.

**Layer 3 — game / video code.** Consumers instantiate adapters
by resource path, feed them domain input, get domain output. The
game never touches ggml types directly.

## What this consolidates

Names the RFD 2229 candidates that this RFD acts on:

| project | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| motion-bricks-cpp | own C++ module + own ggml pin + own CMake | one shared `modules/ggml/` + `motion_bricks.gd` adapter |
| kimodo | own C++ module + own ggml pin | shared `modules/ggml/` + `kimodo.gd` adapter |
| skin-tokens-cpp | own C++ module + own ggml pin | shared `modules/ggml/` + `skin_tokens.gd` adapter |

Result: **one native module, N GDScript adapter files**, instead
of N per-project C++ modules with parallel build systems and
parallel ggml pins.

## Trade vs the RISC-V ELF path

RFD 2213 puts godot-vrm inside a sandbox as a compiled ELF via
libriscv (`modules/sandbox/`). Adapter-in-GDScript trades vs
adapter-in-ELF:

| | GDScript adapter | RISC-V ELF adapter |
|---|---|---|
| build | none (script edit + reload) | cross-compile to riscv-elf |
| iteration | editor hot-reload | rebuild + repackage |
| third-party untrusted code | can't run C/Rust | can run any language |
| performance | GDScript VM (fine for orchestration) | libriscv (fine for compute) |
| sandbox | Godot script permissions | libriscv memory isolation |

**Recommended pick per case:**

- **Adapter is orchestration + tensor-shape juggling** (tokenizer
  setup, LoRA scaling factors, chat template, prompt formatting,
  output post-processing): **GDScript**. This is where all three
  ggml consumers live today.
- **Adapter runs third-party untrusted code** (a downloaded
  planner from a scene marketplace, a mod-supplied model wrapper):
  **RISC-V ELF via libriscv** (same as RFD 2213's VRM path).

The workspace ships trusted models we hold; GDScript adapters
cover every current case. The ELF path stays available for the
mod-supplied case if it appears.

## Sequencing

Follow-up L1 RFDs, one per step:

1. Add `2-contract/ggml/` as a module under
   `entities-godot-sandbox/modules/ggml/`. Wire the GDExtension
   surface. First `Ggml.load_model()` + `Ggml.run_inference()`
   round-trip.
2. Author `motion_bricks.gd` adapter. Port whatever's in
   motion-bricks-cpp's adapter code (`src/root.cpp` planner
   glue, tokenizer bindings) to GDScript. Verify inference
   matches the C++ baseline on a fixed motion prompt.
3. Retract RFD 2212 (motion-bricks-as-native-godot-module) —
   the module doesn't exist as an independent thing anymore;
   its C++ becomes part of `modules/ggml/`'s WebGPU backend
   sourcing, its adapter becomes `motion_bricks.gd`.
4. Repeat for kimodo and skin-tokens-cpp as separate L1s.
5. Once all three ggml consumers are on the shared module,
   trim their standalone C++ repos from the goal manifest.

## Verification

- **Inference-parity gate.** For each adapter, a fixture prompt
  round-trips through both the pre-migration C++ path and the
  post-migration adapter+module path; outputs match byte-for-
  byte (or within f32 tolerance for stochastic samplers seeded
  identically).
- **Adapter-iteration measurement.** Editor reload time on an
  adapter edit against baseline C++ rebuild-and-relink time.
  If the ratio isn't at least 10:1 in GDScript's favor, the
  interchangeable-parts win is fictional.
- **Module-count enumeration.** `git ls-files modules/*/config.py`
  under `entities-godot-sandbox` shows one ggml-consuming
  module (not three) once migration completes.

## Blast radius

The three consuming projects (motion-bricks-cpp, kimodo,
skin-tokens-cpp) are pre-ship — no downstream depends on their
current C++ ABI. This migration doesn't break anyone external.

Internal churn: RFD 2212's planned `modules/motionbricks/`
becomes `modules/ggml/`; RFD 2214's model bundle loader still
returns the same bytes, the caller changes from C++ (`mb_model_load_from_memory`)
to GDExtension (`Ggml.load_model_from_bytes`).
