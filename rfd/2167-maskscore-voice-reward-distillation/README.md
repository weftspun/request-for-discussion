# RFD 2167: Voice-clone reward-model distillation

**State:** discussion
**Feature:** distill the wavlm_cos + voxtral_wer scoring signal from
RFD 2164.3 into a fast reward model usable in RL fine-tuning of voice
models. Parallels EditScore for image edits.

**Shelved 2026-09-02:** 2167.1/.2 need GPU time not budgeted; rented
compute is blocklisted. Nothing on the Rung 1 queue depends on this.
**Scope:** `6-datasource/anny-render-corpus`

## Decision

Train a small reward model that predicts our composite score from
raw audio, then freeze it as the reward signal for RL fine-tuning.

  base       Gemma-4-12B QAT Q4_0 (Apache-2.0, already local)
  training   pairwise ranking on 150 rank pairs from RFD 2164
  input      (reference_audio, target_text, candidate_audio)
  output     scalar reward; ~50 ms per pair on MPS
  loss       Bradley-Terry on the 10-rank ladders

Same Gemma serves image + voice reward roles (subsumes the parked
Qwen3-VL -> Gemma swap).

## Problem

The 10-rank voice-clone ladder from RFD 2164.2 has a real gradient
(measured: identity 0.92 -> pitch-shift 0.70 -> wrong subject 0.75 on
wavlm_cos; canonical 0.07 WER -> wrong text 1.94), but the scoring
path is too slow to serve as an RL reward. Voxtral inference takes
5-10s per candidate on MPS; standard RL loops want ~10k rollouts per
epoch, or >24 hours per epoch just for reward computation.
