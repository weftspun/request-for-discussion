## Context and problem statement

Several pieces of the workstation stack need to run as long-lived
background processes that survive shells, log-offs, and reboots, and
restart themselves when they crash:

- the [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) compile-cache
  server(s) backing native builds,
- Godot dedicated/headless game servers,
- a CockroachDB (`crdb`) node for the local RDBMS,
- zone servers and similar per-world daemons.

The naive approaches all failed in practice. Starting these by hand in
a terminal ties them to that shell. The compile cache made the problem
concrete: sccache auto-starts a single machine-wide server on first
use, and whichever project touches it first fixes its configuration
(S3 key prefix, base dirs) for everyone — so a second project silently
inherits the wrong cache namespace. Worse, a configuration that lives
only in a per-build environment forces a stop/start of the server on
every build to apply it, which is slow and races ("Address in use").
None of this is "a service" in the Windows sense: nothing owns the
process lifecycle.

The team has no local administrator access by default, and Windows
`sudo` here runs in Force New Window mode, so any elevation is an
interactive UAC prompt.

## Decision drivers

- Processes must auto-start at boot and auto-restart on crash,
  independent of any interactive session.
- Multiple instances of the same program must coexist without
  clobbering each other's state (e.g. one cache server per project,
  several game/zone servers).
- Secrets (object-store keys, DB credentials) must never be written
  into a repo, a service definition, or the registry — only read at
  runtime from their existing secured location.
- The target programs are plain executables, not native Windows
  services, so they do not implement the Service Control Manager (SCM)
  protocol on their own.
- Setup must be reproducible from a script and reviewable after an
  elevated run.

## Considered options

- Running by hand in a terminal ties the process to that shell: no
  restart and no boot start.
- A Scheduled Task on a logon trigger runs in the user session and
  needs no service wrapper, but it is not a true service (no SCM
  state, weaker restart semantics), and registering one was denied by
  policy on this machine.
- Calling `sc.exe create` directly does not work because the SCM
  expects a process that implements the service protocol; a bare exe
  started this way is killed as non-responsive.
- Wrapping the program with [nssm](https://nssm.cc/) (the Non-Sucking
  Service Manager) puts a thin supervisor in front of it that is a
  proper service and keeps an ordinary foreground process alive,
  restarting it on exit.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: nssm-supervised foreground processes, one Windows
service per instance. nssm satisfies the SCM, so each target runs as a
real auto-start/auto-restart service while staying an ordinary
executable.

The pattern has four parts:

1. Run the target in the foreground, since a supervisor can only watch
   a process that does not fork-and-exit. For sccache that means
   `SCCACHE_START_SERVER=1` + `SCCACHE_NO_DAEMON=1` and invoking the
   bare binary (not `--start-server`, which always daemonizes). Most
   servers (Godot `--headless`, `cockroach start`, zone daemons) are
   already foreground.
2. A per-instance launcher script sets that instance's environment and
   execs the program by absolute path — services run as LocalSystem,
   whose `PATH` does not include user shims (e.g. scoop). Secrets are
   read at runtime from their existing secured file (for sccache, the
   object-store keys come from the `do-tor1` AWS profile in
   `~/.aws/credentials`, exported as
   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` because sccache's S3
   backend ignores AWS profiles). Nothing secret is written to disk by
   the script.
3. An elevated installer script registers each service with nssm, sets
   it to `SERVICE_AUTO_START`, enables restart-on-exit with a
   throttle/delay, points stdout/stderr at rotating log files, and
   starts it. It is idempotent (stop + remove + reinstall) and writes
   a transcript so the result can be reviewed after the separate
   elevated window closes.
4. Instance isolation comes from the port (and namespace): each
   instance listens on its own loopback port; clients select an
   instance by port. Loopback is not session-isolated, so a
   LocalSystem service in session 0 is reachable from the user
   session. sccache additionally uses a distinct S3 key prefix per
   instance.

### Worked example — the sccache services

Two services back two projects from the one shared object-store
bucket, kept apart by port and key prefix:

| Service             | Port | Key prefix  | Base dirs (checkout roots)     |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| `sccache-godot`     | 4227 | `godot`     | the Godot checkout + merge dir |
| `sccache-idtx-flow` | 4226 | `idtx-flow` | the idtx-flow checkouts        |

4226 is sccache's default port, so the idtx-flow builds use that
service with no changes; the Godot build sets `SCCACHE_SERVER_PORT=4227`.
The build wrapper (`gscons`) therefore no longer manages the server at
all — it sets one port variable and runs. This supersedes the earlier
per-build environment juggling and server restarts described in
`rfd/2017-compiling-godot-engine` and `rfd/2016-checking-sccache`.

### Applying the pattern elsewhere

The same launcher + installer shape runs other dev infrastructure as
services:

- Godot dedicated servers get one service per instance, each on its
  own port; the launcher passes `--headless` and the scene/port
  arguments.
- Zone servers get one service per zone/world, isolated by port,
  supervised and restarted independently so one zone crashing does not
  take down the others.
- Zone backends are the per-zone backend daemons
  (state/persistence/matchmaking workers) behind those zone servers,
  each its own service with its own port and runtime-read credentials.
- CockroachDB runs as a `cockroach start` (or `start-single-node`)
  service, with secrets (certs/join tokens) read at runtime and the
  data dir as an absolute path.

## Consequences

- Good: real services — boot start, crash restart, and lifecycle owned
  by the SCM, not a terminal.
- Good: many instances of one binary coexist cleanly (port/namespace
  per service).
- Good: no secrets in the repo, the service config, or the registry;
  they stay in their existing secured files and are read at runtime.
- Good: build/runtime wrappers shrink to "pick a port and run" — no
  server management, no restart races.
- Bad: requires one-time elevation per install/change; with Force New
  Window sudo this is an interactive UAC prompt and the output must be
  logged to a file to be reviewed afterward.
- Bad: services run as LocalSystem in session 0, so launchers must use
  absolute paths and cannot rely on the user environment; anything
  needing the desktop is unsuitable.
- Bad: nssm is an extra dependency to install (via scoop) and keep
  updated.

## Confirmation

After install, both sccache services report `Running` with `Automatic`
start, and `sccache --show-stats` on each port shows the expected S3
backend (`s3, name: <bucket>`) with the correct per-project key prefix
and base dirs — so isolation, credentials, and auto-start all hold. A
subsequent build connects on port 4227 and accumulates cache hits with
zero cache errors.

## More information

- Foreground is the crux: a fork-and-exit daemon makes nssm see an
  immediate exit and enter its rapid-exit guard (`SERVICE_PAUSED`).
  Verify a target stays in the foreground before wrapping it.
- LocalSystem can read another user's secured files (e.g. the AWS
  credentials file), but `$HOME`/`%USERPROFILE%` resolve to the system
  profile — always pass absolute paths to both the launcher and the
  secrets it reads.
- Restart-on-crash plus a throttle/delay avoids a hot loop when a
  target is misconfigured; check the per-service stderr log to
  diagnose.
