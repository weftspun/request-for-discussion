# RFD 1130 details: the rig, and the confounds that will spoil it

## The device

ASUS UGen300: Hailo-10H, 8 GB LPDDR4, USB 3.1 Gen2 at 10 Gbps.
Frameworks accepted are Keras, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch
and ONNX, which in practice means a graph the Dataflow Compiler maps.

8 GB is the number that decides everything else. At bf16 the Pixal3D
checkpoints are 24.045 GB and nothing fits. At four bits they are
about 6 GB and the weights can stay resident, which turns the bus from
a per-inference cost into a one-off.

## The three quantities

| quantity                  | why it is not the others                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| time to first output      | includes transfer, and is what a user feels   |
| steady-state rate         | excludes it, and is what a batch job gets     |
| transferred bytes         | predicts behaviour on a different bus         |

A single "frames per second" hides which of the three it came from,
and the three diverge by more than an order of magnitude on a USB
device.

## First measurements, 2026-08-29

`efficientnet_lite0.hef`, single context, DFC 5.3.0, on the UGen300 over USB. Apparatus:
`hailortcli benchmark` and `hailortcli run2 --measure-latency --measure-overall-latency`
for the rates, and `hailo/rung3_shim.py` for the controlled input.

    steady-state rate         ~1168 FPS   (1177.4 / 1174.0 / 1153.9, spread 2%)
    HW latency, NN core          2.27 ms
    overall latency              3.95 ms
    transferred bytes         150,528 in, 1,000 out per inference
    chip temperature           38.7 - 41.7 C

**The third quantity is the answer to the question this RFD was written to ask.** Overall
minus hardware is **1.68 ms of USB crossing per inference**, 43% of end-to-end latency. It
amortises under pipelining -- 1168 FPS is 0.86 ms per frame against 3.95 ms for a lone
frame -- so the bus is a latency cost and not a throughput cost at this model size. A
resident model pays it once per frame for the activations, not per weight.

At 1168 FPS the input traffic alone is 1168 x 150,528 = **176 MB/s**, against the bus's
~1.2 GB/s. So this model leaves the bus 85% idle, and the "streaming weights cost
everything" case has not been reached at 4.7 MB of HEF.

## THE FIRST PORT WAS STARVING THE DEVICE, AND EVERY EARLIER NUMBER WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG

On the port it was first plugged into, `hailortcli` warned:

    [HailoRT] [warning] USB-C source electrical current advertised: 1.5A.
    The module may run in reduced-performance mode.

Moving it to a USB4 dock re-enumerated it from `usb/001:001` to `usb/001:009` and the
warning stopped. Every figure above was taken after the move.

**The evidence is the absence of the firmware's own flag, not a power reading**, and the
distinction is worth keeping. Neither direct route works: `measure-power` fails with
`HAILO_OPEN_FILE_FAILURE(13)`, and `monitor` -- whose help promises "on H10, presents
performance and health stats" -- reports it "is not supported on Windows". So temperature is
the only proxy available, and **this RFD should not promise a power figure it cannot take.**

**The comparison that would have priced the limit is gone.** No throughput was taken at
1.5A before the move, so the cost of the power limit is unmeasured and only recoverable by
plugging back in on purpose.

**Backfilled 2026-08-29: throughput at 1.5A now exists, and it is the same.** A frame ladder
of raw uint8 transport -- a 1x1 convolution, so the compute is negligible and the number is
the link -- was run at pipeline depth 4 across three different ports, each advertising 1.5A:

    frame    in MB   out MB   ms/frame   frames/s   MB/s
    512p      1.05     0.26      4.83       207       272
    720p      3.69     0.92     15.75        63       293
    1080p     8.29     2.07     33.59        29       302
    4K       33.18     8.29    144.80         7       286

The link plateaus at ~285-300 MB/s and holds there across a 32x range of frame sizes, and
across `usb/004:013`, `usb/001:001` and `usb/004:001` the 4K figure reproduced to within
0.07%. So the 1.5A ports do not differ from each other, and the ~176 MB/s this RFD measured
for the keypoint model sits comfortably under that ceiling -- which is why that model never
felt the limit. **The power question is still open**: every port reached on this desk
advertised 1.5A, so a run at 3.0A remains untaken and the plateau is a 1.5A number until one
is. What is now closed is the within-1.5A comparison the paragraph above called unrecoverable.

**Two software knobs that did not move it.** `HAILO_POWER_MODE_ULTRA_PERFORMANCE` and
`VDevice::dma_map` on the caller's frame buffer were each measured at 4K, depth 4, against a
baseline: 145.8 ms, ultra 146.2 ms, DMA-mapped 144.1 ms, both 146.7 ms -- all within 1.5%,
which is noise. The bounce copy DMA mapping removes is a 33 MB `memcpy` at 25.7 GB/s, 1.29 ms,
0.9% of a frame's 145 ms. At this link speed the copy is not the cost, so zero-copy transport
buys under one percent and its value here is multi-process topology, not throughput.

**Pipelining is where the bus idle time converts to rate.** Queueing frames through
`run_async` instead of one synchronous call climbed 724 -> 2094 FPS on a 16 KB block, 2.89x,
and flattened exactly at the device's own reported async queue depth of 32. That isolates
~0.9 ms of the 1.38 ms single-shot latency as USB round trip, the same crossing this RFD
priced at 1.68 ms for the larger keypoint frame.

## The controlled-input path needed a shim, and the flat C API does not work on H10

`hailortcli` generates its own random inputs and dumps no outputs, so it cannot answer
whether a host-side change reaches the device. HailoRT's flat C API is exported and binds
cleanly -- all 17 declarations in `hailo/hailort.sigs` resolve against `libhailort.dll` --
and the Hailo-10H **rejects it**:

    hailo_init_configure_params_by_vdevice -> HAILO_NOT_IMPLEMENTED(7)
    [HailoRT] [error] Did you try calling create_configure_params on H10?
                      If so, use InferModel instead

`InferModel` returns `Expected<std::shared_ptr<InferModel>>`, which ctypes cannot call, and
the DLL exports no `extern "C"` entry points for it -- 245 mangled C++ symbols and no flat
ones. `hailo_platform`, Hailo's Python bindings, are not on PyPI and are not shipped with
the HailoRT 5.3.2 Windows install: `lib/` holds `libhailort.lib` and cmake files only.

So `hailort_shim.cpp` wraps `InferModel` in six `extern "C"` functions, declared in
`hailort_shim.sigs` and bound by `sigs_ctypes.py` -- the same declarative-ABI convention
this workspace uses for `iceoryx2.sigs` and `openvr_api.sigs`. 178 KB, built with clang++
against `libhailort.lib`.

With it, on `efficientnet_lite0`:

    different inputs   -> different outputs, so the device computes on what is sent
    same input twice   -> bit-identical, deterministic
    undersized buffer  -> refused, status 2

## A host-side change reaches the device, which is what a scoring loop needs

Three HEFs of one architecture, compiled from authored ONNX:

    variant   kernels sha         conv1 out_scale   device output
    base      58710ab3776b8531        6.44e-05      mean 85.989
    weights   1c35cff027a49580        6.72e-05      mean 79.814
    scale     f8830de2b0930035        1.79e-04      mean 84.769

**base against weights: 7,946 of 8,192 output bytes differ**, and a rerun of base is
bit-identical. So author -> DFC -> HEF -> silicon -> a score the host can read is closed,
and an on-device evaluation loop has a foundation.

**The scale row is confounded and is recorded rather than used.** `force_range_out` moved
conv1's scale 2.8x as asked, but the kernel hash changed too: the optimiser re-derives
weight quantisation, bias correction and its distillation pass against the new range. So
forcing a range is not a scale-only perturbation, which matters to anything built on QZO --
see `logbook-dfc-emulation-contexts-disagree.md`.

Compile cost, for anything that recompiles per generation: **optimize 12.9-15.9 s, compile
4.5-5.0 s** for a two-conv graph, and **8.7 s** to compile a 131k-parameter stack.

## Confounds worth naming before they are discovered

**Thermal.** A USB stick has a small thermal budget. A rate measured
over ten seconds and a rate measured over ten minutes are different
numbers, and the second is the one that matters.

**Host contention.** USB 3.1 Gen2 is shared. A measurement taken while
the same controller carries anything else is not a measurement of the
device.

**Cold caches.** The first inference includes compilation, allocation
and transfer. Report it separately rather than averaging it away.

## What the comparison is for

The 3090 will win on rate and lose on power, and neither fact is
interesting on its own. The comparison exists so somebody can decide
where a stage runs, which needs the cost of moving data to it stated
beside the rate.

## What is not measured here

Accuracy. RFD 1128 owns that, and mixing the two produces a table
where a fast wrong answer looks good.
