# RFD 1126 details: the rig budget, the unrolled cost, and what is unmeasured

Every section names its gate in an HTML comment under its heading, per RFD 1125.

## Why unrolling and not a student

<!-- gate: tropes -->

The first draft of this RFD reached for a learned regressor, and the reasoning
looked sound: the head is being retrained anyway for 104 points, so make the
replacement one an accelerator can run. What that misses is which property was
being spent.

`soma_referee.py` is explicit about it. A parametric model cannot represent an
impossible skeleton, and a discriminative estimator can: a heatmap peak lands
where it lands, and nothing in the architecture forbids an elbow bending
backwards or a limb changing length between frames. The referee was built around
that asymmetry. Replacing the fit with a regressor puts the estimator back where
the parametric model was, and calls it progress.

Unrolling keeps it. A fixed number of descent steps through the ANNY forward is
still descent through a forward we own, with the iteration count frozen instead
of decided at run time. The pose it emits is reachable because the
parameterisation says so, not because training made it likely.

The clamp is what makes that claim survive compilation. `swing-twist-kusudama`
already has joint limits stated in Lean 4 and checked against Godot's own
output, and clamping swing and twist at every unrolled step is a `Clip`, which
compiles. So the guarantee holds in a feed-forward graph, which is the thing a
regressor cannot offer at any accuracy.

**How the clamp is built is decided, and it is not the obvious reading.** No
kusudama carries two or more cones. A joint limit that a multi-cone kusudama
was being asked to express is built as a concatenation of pairwise ones. The
measurement behind that is in `humanoid-rom/FINDINGS.md`: three equidistant
cones, 120 degrees apart, sum to `4.003e-16`, so the pole derived by summing
cone centres and normalising is degenerate, and one unit in the last place
moves it by 45 degrees.

That helps the graph rather than costing it. A pairwise kusudama is small and
fixed, a concatenation of them is a fixed-length chain, and the whole
constraint stays feed-forward with no data-dependent count. Deriving a pole
would have needed a normalise whose input can be zero, and an INT8 pipeline has
no good answer for that division.

## What actually blocked the accelerator

<!-- gate: ste100 -->

Three obstacles, in order of severity. Precision is the third.

| obstacle | why it blocks | remedy |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `line_search_fn="strong_wolfe"` | data-dependent loop; `Loop` and `If` fail | unroll to fixed steps |
| `max_iter=300`, `history_size=50` | 50 stored gradient pairs, deep unroll    | warm-start           |
| `float64`                        | INT8 activations are the widest available | measure the residual |

The `float64` in `lbfgs_polish.py` follows from `tolerance_grad=1e-10` and
`tolerance_change=1e-12` in the same call. Float32 carries about 1e-7 relative
precision, so those tolerances are unmeasurable in it. They are offline
convergence targets for producing retarget data. At 120 fps the solver starts
from the previous frame and applies a correction.

Compensated arithmetic, which represents one high-precision value as a sum of
two low-precision ones, is available if the residual proves insufficient. Reach
for it after measuring rather than before. It costs 2x to 4x the operations, and
it means carrying residual channels through a quantizer that will try to rescale
them.

## The unrolled solver is free

<!-- gate: ste100 -->

Fitting to keypoints needs the kinematic chain, not the mesh. Composing a 3x2
rotation for each of 104 bones and projecting into four views is about 8,500
multiply-accumulates. One descent step is roughly three times that, for the
forward and its gradient.

| stage                              | cost per frame |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 25 unrolled descent steps          | 0.64 MMAC      |
| 4-view backbone, 3 at 288 + 1 at 432 | 102.1 GMAC   |
| solver as a share of the rig       | 0.0006%        |

Posing all 13,718 vertices, which the silhouette and depth fits need, is 0.7
MMAC per evaluation. Even 25 steps carrying the full mesh is 0.05 GMAC.

The solver was never a compute problem. It was a control-flow problem wearing a
precision problem's clothes.

## The rig on one device

<!-- gate: ste100 -->

Three body cameras and one face camera, one architecture on all four, on a
single 40 TOPS INT4 accelerator. Backbone measured at `num_windows=1`, decoder
included.

Utilisation needed for four cameras at one resolution:

| resolution | GMAC  | at 120 fps | at 90 fps | at 60 fps |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| 288        | 17.8  | 43%        | 32%       | 21%       |
| 336        | 25.8  | 62%        | 46%       | 31%       |
| 384        | 35.9  | 86%        | 65%       | 43%       |
| 432        | 48.7  | over 100%  | 88%       | 58%       |
| 576        | 107.9 | over 100%  | over 100% | over 100% |

Four cameras at 432 and 120 fps is not available on one device. It needs 117% of
the part at perfect utilisation, before any overhead.

**So the cameras must differ.** Precision is wanted on the face and not on the
body, because a face camera frames a 200 mm face and a body camera frames a
1.7 m person.

| rig                          | fps | utilisation | body stride         | face stride     |
| ---------------------------- | --- | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 3 at 288 plus 1 at 432       | 120 | 61%         | 71 mm, a soda can   | 5.6 mm, a pencil |
| 3 at 288 plus 1 at 384       | 120 | 54%         | 71 mm, a soda can   | 6.2 mm, a pencil |
| 3 at 336 plus 1 at 432       | 120 | 76%         | 61 mm, a soda can   | 5.6 mm, a pencil |
| 3 at 336 plus 1 at 432       | 90  | 57%         | 61 mm, a soda can   | 5.6 mm, a pencil |

Three views at 71 mm triangulating is a different measurement from one view
guessing, which is why the body cameras can be starved. The z-test that computes
`visibility` in RFD 1122's schema is the same idea applied to labels.

## What is unmeasured, and matters

<!-- gate: ste100 -->

**Utilisation.** Every percentage above divides by 40 TOPS as though the part
reaches peak. It does not. If the true figure is 50%, the 61% rig becomes 122%
and nothing in that table fits. The Dataflow Compiler has a profiler and it has
not been run. Treat the table as a ranking, not a budget.

**Two resolutions is two compiled graphs.** Switching context per frame on one
device has a cost that is not counted here, and it may erase the saving. A
uniform rig at 288 and 43% may beat the asymmetric rig at 61%.

**Ingest.** Four synchronised 120 fps streams is 480 frames per second to move
and time-align before any of this arithmetic applies.

**Calibration.** The rig needs extrinsics. No code in the workspace solves them.

**Temporal coherence.** Per-frame fits at 120 fps will jitter. Warm-starting
helps the step count and does not by itself make the output smooth.

**The residual itself.** How close an unrolled fit with K steps gets, as a
percentage of stature, at the precision the part offers, is the number this
decision rests on and nobody has taken it.
