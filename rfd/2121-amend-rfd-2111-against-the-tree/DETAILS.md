## How this was checked

Every count below comes from the GitHub API or from a checkout on disk, on
2026-08-16, against `repo` manifest revision `main`. Each claim states the
command that produces it, so a later reader can re-run it rather than trust the
number.

The renames of RFD 2111 have landed. GitHub answers the old names with the new
ones:

```sh
gh api repos/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/fabric-authority-plane --jq .full_name
# v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/interactor-authority
gh api repos/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/fabric-interactor --jq .full_name
# v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/contract-command
gh api repos/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/fabric-service-meta --jq .full_name
# v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/fabric
```

## The prefix survives in five live names

```sh
gh api "orgs/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/repos?per_page=100" --paginate --jq '.[].name' | grep '^fabric-'
```

Fifteen names carry the prefix. The bare `fabric` is the sixteenth match for
`^fabric` and is the name RFD 2111 frees, so it is excluded here.

| `fabric-casync-central`       | yes      | no   | no, archived           |

| `fabric-quickstart`           | no       | no   | yes                    |
| `fabric-scoop-central`        | yes      | no   | no, archived           |
| `fabric-stage-runtime`        | no       | no   | yes                    |
| `fabric-wholebody-control`    | no       | yes  | no, upstream name      |
| `fabric-wt-harness`           | no       | no   | yes                    |

Five archived and four forks leave six live and owned. RFD 2111 names
`fabric-harness` and says it becomes `contract-bus` when that pass is taken,
which leaves five the RFD does not mention at all.

Two of the five sit in the `repo` manifest and check out on every `repo sync`:
`fabric-godot-assembly` and `fabric-wt-harness`. A reader of the workspace root
sees the retired prefix on the first listing.

## `entities-godot` is the engine

```sh
gh api repos/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/entities-godot/contents --jq '[.[].name]|join(" ")'
```

scu_builders.py servers tests thirdparty version.py
```

`SConstruct`, `editor/`, `drivers/`, `platform/`, `servers/`, `modules/`, and
`thirdparty/` are the Godot engine tree, 1 708 369 KB of C++ by the API's own
size field. The Netflix definition of an entity is a domain object that has no
knowledge of where it is stored. An engine that renders, builds, and ships an
editor holds many things, and a set of such domain objects is a small part of
none of the directories above.

RFD 2111 defends this name in one paragraph, and the paragraph argues a different
point: that the `core/` directory inside the repository comes from upstream and
must keep its name. That reasoning is sound and this RFD keeps it. It says
nothing about whether `entities-` describes the repository.

The test RFD 2111 applies elsewhere is whether a name asserts something false.
`fabric-service-meta` was rejected as `service-meta` because "`service-meta` would
assert the thing that is false". `contract-command` was chosen over
`interactor-anything` because the latter "picks the side the git repository exists
to avoid picking". `entities-godot` fails the same test and is the seventh name
the shape does not decide.

## `repositories/` puts the created collision in the tree

RFD 2111 renames the RFD 2028 triad in three git repositories. Those three exist
and hold the triad, which the API confirms:

```sh
for r in loot combat progression; do
  gh api "repos/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/$r/contents" --jq '[.[]|select(.type=="dir").name]|join(" ")'
done
# loot:        .github adapters core ports
# combat:      adapters core ports
# progression: adapters core ports
```

RFD 2111 states the resolution for the word it takes from Netflix: write "git
repository" in full, and keep "repository" alone for the interface. It chooses
that over keeping Cockburn's "port" on the ground that "a collision in prose costs
less than a collision in code".

A directory named `repositories/` sits in the tree of a git repository, which is
the place the RFD ranks as the more expensive of the two. The plural reads as a
collection of checkouts, which is the meaning the RFD spends the section pushing
away. The singular `repository/` reads as the interface, matches `core/` and
`ports/` in number, and costs nothing to adopt because the rename has not run yet.

The other two renames in that triad stand. `core/` to `entities/` and `adapters/`
to `datasources/` carry no collision.

Three git repositories named `loot`, `combat`, and `progression` are also absent
from the rename list and from the `repo` manifest, and their names state no type.
Whether the type-first convention reaches them is a question this RFD raises and
does not answer, because the answer decides three more names.

## The gap is two READMEs rather than five

RFD 2111 says the `lean-*-core` READMEs state a hexagon layout of `core/`,
`ports/`, and `adapters/`, that those directories do not exist, and that each of
those git repositories holds one Lean namespace directory. The checkout disagrees
in two of the five.

```sh
for d in entities-lean-*; do
  printf '%-28s ' "$d"
  find "$d" -type d -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -name .git | sed "s|^$d/||" | tr '\n' ' '
  echo
done
```

| git repository              | the directories it holds                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `entities-lean-combat`      | `CombatCore`                                       |
| `entities-lean-loot`        | `r128gpu` `r128test` `parity` `LootCore` `.github` |
| `entities-lean-progression` | `ProgressionCore`                                  |
| `entities-lean-rebac`       | `Rebac` `Rebac/core` `Rebac/ports` `.github`       |
| `entities-lean-shared`      | `Shared` `.github`                                 |

`entities-lean-rebac` holds `core/` and `ports/`, one namespace directory down,
and both carry Lean sources: `Rebac/core/NoGod.lean`, `Rebac/core/ReBAC.lean`,
and `Rebac/ports/AuthQuery.lean`. Its README says

> - `core/` — dependency-free domain logic + proofs
> - `ports/` — narrow driving (source) / driven (sink) contracts

which describes what is there. The correction it needs is the prefix `Rebac/` on
each path, and the removal of `adapters/`, which the repository does not have.

`entities-lean-loot` holds three directories beside `LootCore`, so "one Lean
namespace directory" describes three of the five rather than all of them.

Three of the five carry no README at all, which is the larger half of this gap:

```sh
for d in entities-lean-*; do printf '%-28s %s\n' "$d" "$(git -C "$d" ls-files | grep -ci readme)"; done
# entities-lean-combat       0
# entities-lean-loot         0
# entities-lean-progression  0
# entities-lean-rebac        2
# entities-lean-shared       1
```

So RFD 2111 describes five READMEs where two exist. `entities-lean-shared` is the
one whose layout section is wholly false: it names the triad and the repository
holds `Shared/Types.lean` and nothing else. `entities-lean-rebac` is the one that
needs its paths qualified, in both its top-level README and the second one at
`Rebac/README.md`, which names an `adapters/` that is absent.

One README to correct and one to qualify. The count in that section, and the
sentence "Those directories do not exist", are the two claims to amend. Whether
`combat`, `loot`, and `progression` should gain a README is a separate question
this RFD does not answer.

## What this RFD leaves alone

The conversion table, the retirement of plane, edge plane, domain, and store
plane, the type-first name shape, the thirty renames, and the reasoning for
"interactor" over the alternatives all hold. Every one of them was checked
against the organisation and matches.

The `domain` field on the wire in RFD 2091 is still unrenamed, and still needs
its own RFD, as RFD 2111 says.
