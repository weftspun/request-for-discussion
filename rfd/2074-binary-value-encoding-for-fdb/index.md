title: "RFD 2074: Binary value encoding for FDB values"
rfd: "2074"
state: published
scope: zone-server-h2o FDB value format
---

## Problem

A warehouse row costs roughly 350 bytes in JSON. A protobuf or JSON
payload also needs a parsing step before code can use FDB's returned
value pointer. The project needed a value format that avoids both
costs.

## Decision

Encode TPC-C row values as packed C structs with network byte order
(big-endian) integers, using `#pragma pack(push, 1)` for a
deterministic layout. No protobuf, no JSON, and no FDB tuple layer for
values. A packed struct casts directly from FDB's returned value
pointer, so there is no parsing step. A warehouse row is 109 bytes
packed, versus roughly 350 bytes in JSON. The tuple layer stays
reserved for keys, where lexicographic ordering matters. Values do not
need that ordering.
