# RFD 1136 details: The grid, the sequence it is not, and what a render costs

## The vocabulary, verbatim

| azimuth | phrase                    |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| 0       | front view                |
| 45      | front-right quarter view  |
| 90      | right side view           |
| 135     | back-right quarter view   |
| 180     | back view                 |
| 225     | back-left quarter view    |
| 270     | left side view            |
| 315     | front-left quarter view   |

| elevation | phrase          | distance | phrase      |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| -30       | low-angle shot  | 0.6      | close-up    |
| 0         | eye-level shot  | 1.0      | medium shot |
| 30        | elevated shot   | 1.8      | wide shot   |
| 60        | high-angle shot |          |             |

The trigger token is `<sks>` and the order is azimuth, elevation,
distance: `<sks> front view low-angle shot close-up`.

## What the bands are, and why the inverse is not a function

A phrase is a band and a parameter is a point, so reading a prompt back
gives an interval. Boundaries sit midway between neighbours. Distance
boundaries are geometric, because 0.6, 1.0 and 1.8 are multipliers: the
arithmetic midpoint of 0.6 and 1.0 is 0.8 and the geometric one is 0.775,
and the second sits midway in the quantity being scaled.

    azimuth    front view [337.5, 22.5)  and seven more at 45 degree steps
    elevation  low-angle [-45, -15)  eye-level [-15, 15)
               elevated [15, 45)     high-angle [45, 75)
    distance   close-up [0.4, 0.775) medium [0.775, 1.342) wide [1.342, 2.2)

The front view's band wraps through zero. `in_band` knows that and a bare
comparison does not: the enumeration found 36 sampled front views in 480
that a naive check placed in no band at all.

## The render sequence in that vocabulary

Five of the eight views `sphere_hammersley_sequence` produces at n=8 have
no phrase, because their elevations sit between the vocabulary's steps.

| view | azimuth | elevation | phrase                                    |
| ---- | ------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0    | 0       | -90       | none. -90 is below the -45 band floor     |
| 1    | 180     | -30       | back view low-angle shot medium shot      |
| 2    | 90      | 0         | right side view eye-level shot medium shot |
| 3    | 270     | 9.6       | left side view eye-level shot medium shot |
| 4    | 45      | 19.5      | front-right quarter view elevated shot    |
| 5    | 225     | 30        | back-left quarter view elevated shot      |
| 6    | 135     | 41.8      | back-right quarter view elevated shot     |
| 7    | 315     | 56.4      | front-left quarter view high-angle shot   |

Views 3, 4, 6 and 7 have no exact phrase and take the band that holds
them. View 0 has neither.

## The grid as constructed training data, and the rule it collides with

The proposal is to render the ANNY corpus through all 96 poses, pairing
each render with the prompt that names it. The provenance is better than
the LoRA's own: these are constructed synthetic, rendered deterministically
from assets we hold, so the labels are true by construction and the same
seed reproduces the corpus. fal's page says "3000+ Gaussian Splatting
renders" and names no engine, no assets and no image count, so their grid
is reusable and their corpus is not reproducible from what is published.

CLAUDE.md says views come from `sphere_hammersley_sequence` and that a
different camera sequence is not chosen instead. A 96-pose grid is a
different camera sequence, so this needs deciding rather than doing.

The distinction that resolves it, if it is accepted: the Hammersley
sequence exists to measure error without a view being picked to flatter
it, and the grid exists to pair a render with the words for its camera.
The first is a measurement instrument and the second is a label. A grid
used for measurement would be the failure the rule was written for, and
the rule should say which of the two it governs.

## What it costs

Measured on this desk at 1024 by 1024, 128 spp:

| renderer                 | per frame | 96 poses  | reproducible |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------- | ------------ |
| `llvm_ad_rgb`, 1 thread  | 78 s      | 2 h 5 min | yes          |
| `cuda_ad_rgb`            | under 1 s | under 2 min | no         |

Corpus data is compared across time, so the corpus grid is the llvm row.
Two hours per subject is the number to plan against, and it is the reason
this is a decision rather than a script somebody runs tonight.

## Can the Hammersley sequence cover the 96 poses? No, and twice over

### It has no distance axis at all

`sphere_hammersley` returns a yaw and a pitch. The radius is not part of it:
`render_view.camera` computes `sqrt(3)/2/sin(fov/2)`, one distance fixed by
the field of view, and the CLI exposes no distance flag. So the sequence
addresses 32 of the 96 poses at most, and the three distances are a
multiplier that would have to be added to `render_view` before any of this
is renderable.

### It does not land on the grid either

Coverage of the 32 azimuth-by-elevation cells, measured as the great-circle
angle from each cell to the nearest sequence point:

| n    | within 1 deg | within 2 deg | within 5 deg | worst cell |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| 8    | 3 of 32      | 3 of 32      | 4 of 32      | 60.0 deg   |
| 32   | 1 of 32      | 1 of 32      | 1 of 32      | 36.9 deg   |
| 96   | 0 of 32      | 0 of 32      | 5 of 32      | 19.9 deg   |
| 192  | 0 of 32      | 0 of 32      | 8 of 32      | 12.9 deg   |
| 384  | 0 of 32      | 0 of 32      | 16 of 32     | 10.8 deg   |
| 768  | 0 of 32      | 0 of 32      | 24 of 32     | 7.6 deg    |
| 1536 | 0 of 32      | 0 of 32      | 32 of 32     | 3.8 deg    |
| 3072 | 0 of 32      | 24 of 32     | 32 of 32     | 2.1 deg    |
| 6144 | 24 of 32     | 32 of 32     | 32 of 32     | 1.2 deg    |

Covering every cell to 5 degrees takes 1536 renders, to 2 degrees 3072, and
1 degree is not reached at 6144 for eight of the cells. On the card that is
26 minutes, 51 minutes and over an hour and a half; at llvm's 78 s a frame
the first row of that is 33 hours, for one subject.

The count of exact hits FALLING as n goes from 8 to 32 is not noise. At n=8
the radical inverse in base 2 gives azimuths of exactly 0, 180, 90 and 270,
and three of those points also land on an elevation the vocabulary names.
Those three are precisely the three views of the n=8 sequence that
`describe_camera` names exactly. Larger n fills the sphere with points that
are near the grid and not on it.

### So they answer different questions

A low-discrepancy sequence exists to cover a sphere without a view being
chosen, and a grid exists to put a known camera beside a known phrase. Asking
the sequence to reproduce the grid spends 1536 renders to approximate 32
poses that can be written down exactly. The grid is 96 lines of parameters.

The recommendation is therefore to generate the grid directly for labelled
pairs and keep the sequence for measurement, and to add a distance multiplier
to `render_view` before either. That leaves CLAUDE.md's rule about the
sequence intact for what it governs, which is measurement.

## The sweep is a video, not 96 loose files

`transport-cineform-tui` already encodes CineForm into Matroska, RGB_444 or
RGBA_4444 with `-alpha`, driven through `service-cineform`. A 96-pose sweep
is 96 frames of one subject, so it is a clip rather than a directory, and the
deliverables rule already asks for a video or image intermediate carrying a
`.cff` title and metadata.

    cineform-tui [options] sweep-<subject>.mkv

The grid's enumeration order is what makes this work: azimuth runs fastest,
so frame index maps to pose, and a truncated file is a partial sweep of one
elevation rather than a partial sweep of everything.

Three things to settle before it replaces the PNGs.

- **The frame hash changes meaning.** CineForm is visually lossless and is not
  bit-exact, so a decoded frame will not carry the PNG's sha256. Either the
  hash moves to the container, or the per-frame hash stops being the check it
  is now. This is the reason to decide rather than to switch quietly.
- **The labels must stay machine-readable.** The per-frame camera parameters
  and their prompts belong in a parquet beside the clip, keyed by frame index,
  or in the container's tags. A clip whose labels live only in a filename is
  not a corpus.
- **Alpha is a choice.** The renders are RGB today. A matte needs
  `-alpha` and RGBA_4444, which is a different encode and a different size.

## The encode is not the cost, and here is the arithmetic

`interactor-cineform` reports its own throughput on a 16-thread CPU: 6 frames
of 1920 by 1080 in 67 ms, about 112 fps, and 60 frames of 640 by 360 in
40 ms, about 1810 fps.

A sweep is 96 grid poses plus the 48-view sequence, so 144 frames of 1024 by
1024. At the measured 1080p rate that is 1.3 seconds. Scaling by pixel count
suggests about 220 fps at this frame size and so 0.7 seconds, and that figure
is an extrapolation rather than a measurement, which is why both are given.

Against the render it disappears. 144 frames on the card is about 144
seconds, and at llvm's 78 s a frame it is 3 hours 7 minutes. The encode is
under one percent of the fast path and a rounding error on the slow one.

So the container is free and the question the previous section raises is the
only one that matters: what the frame hash means once the frames are
visually lossless rather than identical.

## The subjects behind these numbers

Two of the three subjects rendered through this grid were deleted on
2026-08-25 as invalid poses: the hv_1 fit at a chest facing of 345.9
degrees and the hv_2 fit at 72.7. Both came from an unconstrained
17-point solve, and both crossed limbs across the body while reporting a
residual under 0.04% of stature.

The ANNY rest pose at 270 degrees is the surviving subject and the one
the grid's own citation names. The facings are kept here because they
are what made the phrases correct, and because a reader who finds only
the rest pose should know the other two existed and why they do not.
