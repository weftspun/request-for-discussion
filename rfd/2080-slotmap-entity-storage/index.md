title: "RFD 2080: Slotmap entity storage with generational IDs"
rfd: "2080"
state: published
scope: zone-server-h2o in-memory entity storage

## Problem

In-memory entity storage per zone used a hash map or a linked list
approach. A hash map of 200 entities touches about 8 random cache
lines per iteration. A linked list needs pointer-chasing, and both
approaches cost more than a sequential scan.

## Decision

Use a slotmap for in-memory entity storage per zone, replacing hash
map and linked list approaches. A slotmap is a sparse set with
generational indices. Each zone owns one thread-local slotmap. FDB
stays the durable backing store, and the slotmap is the hot in-memory
index for tick processing. Iterating 200 entities in a slotmap's dense
array touches about 8KB sequentially, roughly one L1 miss after
warmup. A hash map of the same size touches about 8 random cache
lines, and a linked list needs pointer-chasing.

Generational (index, version) handles prevent ABA problems, where a
recycled slot looks like a live entity. A stale handle's
version mismatch returns null instead of the wrong entity. The team
rejected a full ECS framework like EnTT as unjustified overhead for
one component type and one system. The slotmap is about 100 lines of
C, against EnTT's roughly 15,000 lines of C++, at comparable iteration
speed for this workload.
