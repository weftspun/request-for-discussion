## Context and problem statement

The organization shares one GitHub Actions runner pool across every
repository, observed at roughly 14–20 concurrent jobs. A single push
to the Godot fork triggers a matrix of about 20 jobs, and the slowest
of them (sanitizer and Windows builds) hold a runner for one to two
hours. Pushes arrive from fix branches, pull requests, merge commits,
reruns, and even archive repositories that carry the same workflow
files. When arrivals outpace the pool, every queued job waits behind
work that may carry no information at all. How does CI work get
admitted to the runner pool so that signal arrives quickly?

## Decision drivers

- The pool is a queueing system with a small fixed number of servers:
  as utilization approaches saturation, waiting time grows without
  bound (M/M/c behaviour), and the delay hits short high-signal jobs
  as hard as long ones.
- One logical change can spawn several full matrices: a branch push
  and its pull request double-trigger, the merge push triggers again,
  and a rerun repeats whatever already ran.
- Some queued work is known in advance to produce nothing: a job whose
  fix is not on the branch yet fails with certainty, and a run on a
  merged or deleted ref validates nothing.
- Diagnostics need CI hardware (a crash that only reproduces on GCC
  Linux runners) but not the whole matrix.

## Considered options

- Unbounded admission: push and rerun freely, let GitHub queue
  everything.
- Hard concurrency caps in workflow configuration (per-repo
  `concurrency` groups beyond the existing per-branch cancellation).
- An operating discipline that bounds arrivals at the source: batch,
  sequence, and cancel zero-information work.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: an operating discipline that bounds arrivals at the
source, because the waste comes from how work is submitted, not from
how GitHub schedules it — and a discipline adapts per situation where
a hard cap blocks urgent work behind stale work.

The discipline:

- Two or three full matrices run at a time; further work waits for a
  slot. A merge push waits until the in-flight run it would
  concurrency-cancel finishes, so partially-completed long jobs are
  not thrown away mid-service.
- Arrivals are batched: fixes land as one commit per push where
  possible, and a late-discovered fix joins an already-open PR branch
  rather than opening a new one. One merge then validates the whole
  batch with a single matrix.
- Zero-information runs are cancelled immediately: the push-event run
  that duplicates a PR's pull-request run, runs still queued on merged
  or deleted refs, runs whose remaining jobs have a known outcome, and
  workflow runs triggered by pushes to archive repositories (Actions
  stays disabled on `godot-archived`).
- Diagnostics are trimmed to one job: a throwaway branch edits the
  workflow down to the single job that reproduces the problem, and
  reuses the warm build cache by keeping the matrix entry's
  `cache-name`. The branch is deleted once the answer is in hand.
- A failed job whose fix is not yet on the branch never reruns; until
  the fix lands it would occupy a server for its full service time and
  return a result that is already known.
- Backlog is admitted selectively: stale branches needing fresh signal
  enter the queue worst-first, one or two at a time, when utilization
  is low rather than as a bulk rerun.

## Consequences

- Good: high-signal jobs spend their time in service, not in queue;
  verdicts on key jobs arrive in roughly the service time of the job
  itself.
- Good: the merge policy (merge on a passing key job) composes cleanly
  — batched PRs mean each merge buys validation for several fixes with
  one matrix.
- Bad: sequencing adds wall-clock latency to individual merges; a
  merge-ready PR waits for an unrelated in-flight run to finish.
- Bad: the discipline lives in operator habit and this record, not in
  enforced configuration; a contributor who pushes freely still floods
  the pool.

## Confirmation

The discipline is in practice on the CHI-364 CI campaign: six
redundant queued runs cancelled in one sweep (two merged PRs'
leftovers, a deleted tag's run, a push/PR duplicate), Actions disabled
on `godot-archived` after an archive push was found competing with the
main repo's queue, a GCC-only segfault diagnosed through a single-job
trimmed workflow over four iterations on a warm cache, and fixes
batched so that two branches reached green with one validation matrix
each.

## More information

The queue is observable with `gh run list --repo <repo> --json
databaseId,status,headBranch` filtered to `queued`/`in_progress`, and
per-run job counts with `gh run view <id> --json jobs`. Little's law
gives the sanity check: jobs in system ≈ arrival rate × time in
system, so when queued jobs exceed the server count several times
over, every new matrix admits about an hour of added latency to its
own verdict.
