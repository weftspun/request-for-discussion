## Both encodings were built and measured

ETF was written first. The decision moved to CBOR after both were shown to reach the same term,
so this records what each cost rather than an argument from taste.

|                          | ETF                        | CBOR, tag 39                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| bytes for the same reply | 60                         | 53                                     |
| decoder on the BEAM      | `:erlang.binary_to_term/2` | `Weft.Reply.decode!/1`, about 60 lines |
| atom safety              | `[:safe]`                  | `String.to_existing_atom/1`            |
| writer in C++            | a hand-rolled term encoder | the existing CBOR writer plus one tag  |
| readers off the BEAM     | an ETF reader in each      | the CBOR library each already has      |
| encodings in the tree    | two                        | one                                    |

Both decoded to `{:error, {:res_below_minimum, %{got: 512, minimum: 1280}}}` on OTP 29. The
term is identical; only the cost of getting there differs.

## The ETF subset that was written

The writer emits eight tags. Nothing else is needed for `:ok`, `{:ok, map}` and
`{:error, reason}`, and a smaller writer is a smaller thing to get wrong.

| tag                   | number | use                                         |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `VERSION_MAGIC`       | 131    | the first byte of every term                |
| `SMALL_ATOM_UTF8_EXT` | 119    | an atom under 256 bytes                     |
| `ATOM_UTF8_EXT`       | 118    | a longer atom                               |
| `SMALL_INTEGER_EXT`   | 97     | 0 to 255                                    |
| `INTEGER_EXT`         | 98     | a signed 32-bit integer                     |
| `BINARY_EXT`          | 109    | an Elixir binary, which is what a string is |
| `SMALL_TUPLE_EXT`     | 104    | a tuple with fewer than 256 elements        |
| `MAP_EXT`             | 116    | a map                                       |

A reply that needs a larger integer, a float, a list or a reference is refused by the writer
rather than encoded. The refusal is the check: a reply shape nobody agreed on does not reach a
caller in a form that decodes.

## The test against a real virtual machine

Run on Erlang/OTP 29, 2026-08-17. The bytes came from the Python writer and went to `elixir`
with no intermediate step.

    decoded: {:error, {:res_below_minimum, %{got: 512, minimum: 1280}}}
    MATCHED {:error, {:res_below_minimum, %{got: 512, minimum: 1280}}}
    is_tuple: true  elem0_is_atom: true

The term is a tuple, its first element is an atom, and it matches the clause a caller writes.

## What `[:safe]` does, measured rather than assumed

The first run above decoded under `[:safe]` although `:res_below_minimum` is not an atom any
release ships. That looked like evidence that `[:safe]` permits new atoms. It is not. The test
script names the atom in its own `case` clause, so compiling the script created the atom before
the decode ran.

A second test used an atom that no module names:

    safe REFUSED it (ArgumentError) => :safe blocks novel atoms
    atom_count before=18541 after=18914
    without :safe: {:error, :zz_never_seen_atom_9f3a2b}

So `[:safe]` refuses an atom the virtual machine does not have, and a decode without it creates
one. Both halves are necessary to the decision: `[:safe]` is what stops a reply from growing the
atom table, and the caller's own clauses are what make the reasons it expects decodable.

This is recorded because the first reading was wrong and the wrong reading was the comfortable
one. A claim about a safety option that nobody runs is a claim that stays wrong.

## Where each writer applies

Two boundaries, and they are not the same boundary. Confusing them is how a project ends up
with an ETF writer inside a NIF, or Fine linked into a process with no virtual machine.

| boundary                         | who writes the term         | why                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| the BEAM calls into C++          | Fine                        | there is an `ErlNifEnv`, and the term never becomes bytes |
| a worker replies over the bus    | the ETF writer              | there is no virtual machine in the process                |
| a worker replies to a RunPod job | the ETF writer, then base64 | the queue carries JSON                                    |

The ETF writer's subset is above. It is small because the second and third rows carry replies
and nothing else; a NIF that passes a resource, a reference or a port is the first row, and
that is Fine's.

## The gate, and what it found

`mix check nifs`, over 39 children: green. `interactor-ward` and `datasource-queen` carry
`thirdparty/taskweft/fine.hpp`, and no first-party source calls `enif_make_*` or `enif_get_*`.

The controls inject a finding, which proves the report and not the scan. The scan was proved
separately by writing a real NIF file into a real project in the manifest:

    FAIL  interactor-see-through-cpp handles Erlang terms in src/nif_probe.cpp and shows no Fine
    FAIL  interactor-see-through-cpp/src/nif_probe.cpp calls enif_make_/enif_get_ directly

The file was then removed and the gate went green again.

One defect was found in the harness while registering it. A concern named in `@concerns` but
absent from `@order` is filtered out of every run, so `mix check nifs` executed no checks and
printed `0 failing check(s)`. A pass over an empty set reads exactly like a pass, which is the
failure `check.ex`'s own documentation warns about.
