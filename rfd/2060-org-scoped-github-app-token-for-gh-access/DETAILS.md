## Context and problem statement

Repository operations against
[`v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric`](https://github.com/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric) —
archiving, renaming, pushing, editing settings — run through `gh` from
a working environment. `gh` was authenticated with a personal OAuth
token (`gho_`, scopes `gist, read:org, repo, workflow`). The `repo`
scope is not org-scoped: it grants read/write/**admin/delete** on
every repository the personal account can reach, across every org and
every private repo. A mistyped owner in a destructive command, or a
leak of that single token, could damage anything the account touches
anywhere on GitHub — far beyond the one org being worked on. `gh`
authenticates per host, not per org, so the limit cannot live in `gh`
config; it has to live in the token.

## Decision drivers

- Confine write/admin reach to the one org, so blast radius stops at
  its boundary.
- Short-lived credentials, so a leak expires on its own rather than
  living until revoked.
- Decouple automation from the personal account, so its cross-org
  access never rides along.
- Least privilege — only the permissions the repo work actually needs.
- Still usable from the CLI and from CI.

## Considered options

- Keep the broad personal OAuth token (`repo` scope).
- A fine-grained Personal Access Token with resource owner set to the
  org.
- A GitHub App installed on the org, minting installation access
  tokens.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: "a GitHub App installed on the org". The App is
installed on `v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric`; a helper
(`~/bin/gh-fabric-token.sh`) reads the App id and private key from
1Password, signs an RS256 JWT, exchanges it for an installation access
token, and exports it as `GH_TOKEN`. `gh` then uses that token with no
`gh auth login`.

An installation token is org-scoped by construction, expires ~1 hour
after minting, and acts as the App rather than the personal account —
covering all three of the top drivers in one mechanism, where a
fine-grained PAT covers org-scoping but stays long-lived and a
human-account secret. The cost is a token-minting step (JWT →
installation token) and guarding the App private key, which 1Password
holds.

The everyday installation is granted `administration: write`,
`contents: write`, `workflows: write`, `actions: read`, `metadata:
read` on all repositories in the org — the set the repo work (push,
edit workflows, archive/rename) needs.

## Consequences

- Good: cross-org private access is impossible — the token cannot read
  or write any private repo outside the org, and cannot act as the
  personal account.
- Good: a leaked token is dead within ~1 hour, with no manual
  revocation step.
- Good: the App is its own identity, so audit-log entries and access
  are decoupled from the personal account's lifecycle.
- Bad: minting needs a JWT-exchange helper rather than a single static
  secret.
- Bad: the App private key is itself high-value (it can mint tokens
  for every install of the App) and must be guarded as carefully as
  the token it replaces.
- Bad: `administration: write` on all repos means the token can still
  archive / rename / delete / transfer any repo _within_ the org — the
  in-org fat-finger case is not mitigated by scoping alone.

## Confirmation

A minted token was probed against the live API. `GET
/installation/repositories` reports 49 repos, `repository_selection:
all`. Org repos are reachable; `GET /user` returns `403 Resource not
accessible by integration` (the token is not the personal account);
private repos in other orgs are unreachable. Public repos elsewhere
stay readable, which is public-is-public and not a private exposure.
The minted token's permissions read back as
`administration/contents/workflows: write, actions/metadata: read`.

## More information

In-org blast radius — every repo, with `administration: write` — is
narrowed further by installing on selected repositories instead of
all, and by splitting off a separate, rarely-used admin App so the
everyday token drops `administration: write`. The accidental
destructive command _within_ the org is caught only by an
out-of-band confirmation step, not by token scoping. This pairs with
the move to podman quadlets on Fedora 44
(`rfd/203d-quadlets-on-fedora-44-instead-of-harvester`), where `gh`
drives the same org's repos that carry the quadlet sources.
