## Context and problem statement

A commit subject is the first line a reader meets in `git log`, a
blame, or a release note. Two conventions compete for how it reads.
Conventional Commits prefixes each subject with a machine-readable
type and optional scope, such as `feat:` or `fix(parser):`, and
lower-cases the summary that follows. Plain prose writes the subject
as an ordinary capitalised sentence. How should a commit subject in
this repo read?

## Decision drivers

- A reader scans the subject as a sentence first, and the meaning sits
  at the front rather than after a colon.
- The repos here run no tooling that consumes a commit type: no
  semantic-release, no changelog keyed on `feat` or `fix`.
- One rule covers every commit, so review needs no judgement about
  which type applies.

## Considered options

- Conventional Commits, with a `type(scope):` prefix on every subject.
- Sentence-case prose subjects with no prefix.
- Free choice of style per author.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: sentence-case prose with no prefix, because the
subject stays a sentence a reader understands on sight, and the repos
gain nothing from a commit type that no tool reads.

A commit subject opens with a capital letter and reads as a plain
sentence, such as `Add the macOS and Windows release workflows`. It
carries no `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, or `type(scope):` prefix, and no
trailing period. The body, where present, states what the change
makes true of the system and why.

## Consequences

- Good, because the subject reads as a summary on its own, with
  nothing to strip before the meaning.
- Good, because the rule holds for every commit, so no author weighs
  whether a change counts as a `feat` or a `fix`.
- Bad, because a changelog tool that groups commits by type finds no
  signal here, so adopting one later needs a different marker or a
  history rewrite.

## Confirmation

Review reads each subject as a capitalised sentence with no type
prefix and no trailing period. The history after this decision shows
subjects in that form.

This pairs with the tenseless continuous-present voice
(`rfd/2025-tenseless-continuous-present-voice`): a commit body states
what the change makes true of the system, the same way comments and
docs do.
