# RFD 1108 details: goals, wrapper math, recentering, and troubleshooting

## Current correct behavior, by mode

VR mode uses a virtual sky background (the app's own sky image),
opaque, no pass-through; scene content stays floor-anchored through
a floor-aligned reference space.

AR mode uses video pass-through, the physical world visible; the
renderer must be transparent and `scene.background` must be null so
the camera feed shows through. Scene content stays floor-anchored
the same way VR's does.

Positioning, in both modes: X is always 0 for the XR scene wrapper
(centered); Z is -0.5 (content sits slightly in front of the user);
Y computes from the model's own bounding box, so its bottom aligns
with floor level (Y=0) in a floor-aligned space.

## Implementation location

Primary file: `src/library/sceneManager.js`. `initialize()` creates
the renderer with `alpha: true`, required for AR transparency.
`enableVR()` installs one unified `renderer.xr.setSession` override
that handles both VR and AR sessions.

## Reference space priority

Requested in this order: `bounded-floor` (preferred on Android XR
and Galaxy XR), `local-floor`, `local`, `viewer`.

On Galaxy XR, `bounded-floor` uses the device's own boundaries
floor-level calibration (Settings, XR, Boundaries, Adjust Floor
Level); inside `bounded-floor`, Y=0 corresponds to the physical
floor level the user configured. No manual "floor height" code is
needed at all; WebXR itself provides a floor-aligned origin.

## Floor anchoring, model bottom to Y=0

On entering either VR or AR:

1. Create an XR wrapper group (`VRSceneWrapper` or `ARSceneWrapper`) holding only model content, never lights, cameras, or helpers.
2. Compute the model's bounding box and its bottom: `modelBottomY = boundingBox.min.y`.
3. Compute the floor alignment: `floorAlignmentY = -modelBottomY`.
4. Set the wrapper's position: `x = 0`, `y = floorAlignmentY`, `z = -0.5`.

This aligns the model's bottom to Y=0 in the chosen reference space,
the physical floor when that space is floor-aligned.

## AR pass-through, keeping the physical background visible

AR must keep the scene transparent: `scene.background = null`,
`renderer.setClearColor(0x000000, 0)`, and
`renderer.domElement.style.background = 'transparent'`.

A sky texture can still load and stay stored for VR's own later use,
but AR must never re-apply it to `scene.background`. In AR,
`scene.environment` may optionally hold a texture for lighting,
while `scene.background` stays null.

### Background snapshot and restore

To return the viewer to the exact same sky orientation after
exiting AR, the app captures a full snapshot of the background state
before any XR session starts: for a texture, `{ textureRef, mapping,
colorSpace, flipY, needsUpdate }`; for a color, a cloned
`THREE.Color` instance; for null, `{ type: 'null', value: null }`.

On AR exit (`handleXRSessionEnd('ar')`), the snapshot restores
exactly as captured, including every texture property, so the sky
never appears flipped or misoriented afterward. The snapshot is
captured inside the unified `setSession` override, before any
XR-specific background change happens, stored in
`this.preXRBackgroundSnapshot`, and cleared once restored.

## VR background, the sky in immersive VR

Some WebXR immersive VR runtimes handle `scene.background` alone
unreliably. The reliable approach: keep an opaque clear alpha
(`renderer.getClearAlpha() === 1`), and use a mesh-based sky (a
large sphere or skybox mesh) mapped with the sky texture, rendered
behind everything else.

## Wrapper centering, X = 0

The XR wrapper's X must stay centered: whenever its position is set,
`x=0`. In AR, the wrapper is anchored, and restored to `x=0` if it
drifts; in VR, the render loop enforces
`VRSceneWrapper.position.x === 0` as a safety guard.

### Auto-centering on session start

On XR session start, the app auto-centers the reference space once,
on the first XR frame, so the viewer starts at X=0 relative to the
app's own world grid. This avoids a common issue on some runtimes:
starting a few grid squares left or right of center.

### Software recenter, a long-press gesture

A software-based recenter, through a long-press gesture on an XR
input source (a controller or headset touchpad), is a fallback for
when platform-level recenter (a Home button) does not affect the
app.

Implementation: hold-tracking uses a `WeakMap` keyed by the stable
`XRSpace` object (`inputSource.targetRaySpace`), not the
`XRInputSource` object reference itself, so tracking survives even
when `session.inputSources` yields a different object instance than
`event.inputSource`. The long-press threshold is 900ms. Supported
inputs: `selectstart`/`selectend` events (for a headset or
controller with no gamepad API), and a gamepad button long-press
(through its `pressed` or `touched` state), with button indices
chosen heuristically from the input source's own profile and
handedness. A 1.5-second cooldown between triggers prevents a repeat
while the button stays held.

Platform recenter support: the app also listens for the XR reference
space's own `reset` event, fired by a platform-level recenter (a
Home button, for instance). On reset, the auto-center flag clears,
so the next XR frame re-runs auto-centering and returns the view to
X=0.

### XR input diagnostics

Enable diagnostic logging with the `?xrDebugInputs=1` query
parameter. Throttled to once per second, it logs input-source
profiles and handedness, the gamepad's own button count, and which
button indices currently read `pressed` or `touched`. This helps
identify which buttons or events a given headset or controller
actually exposes for a recenter gesture.

## Troubleshooting checklist

AR shows the sky, not the physical world: confirm
`scene.background === null`, `renderer.getClearAlpha() === 0`, and
that the canvas's own CSS background is transparent. If AR still
shows a sky, a texture loader may be re-setting `scene.background`,
or the renderer may have been created with `alpha:false` (it must be
`alpha:true` at creation time).

VR shows a black background: confirm
`renderer.getClearAlpha() === 1`, confirm a sky mesh exists (for a
mesh-based sky), and confirm the texture has actually loaded
(`texture.image.complete === true`).
