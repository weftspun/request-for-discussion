WebView path, works with no relay: the APK loads this project's own
URL in a `WebView`, and calls
`evaluateJavascript("__characterStudioNativeFace.push(...)")`
directly. `WebView` does not support `navigator.xr`, so AR/VR must
run in Chrome instead.

Chrome path, needs the relay: the user opens the app menu, "Open in
Chrome for WebXR (+ face)." The APK must keep face tracking alive
while Chrome is foreground, through picture-in-picture,
`FaceKeeperActivity`, and a foreground service.

## FaceKeeperActivity, black-screen guard

`FaceKeeperActivity` is a transparent 1x1 activity. It keeps the
Jetpack XR session host alive while Chrome runs WebXR. A missing
guard below shows the user a black-screen flash on "Open in Chrome
for WebXR (+ face)."

`Theme.FaceKeeper`, in `themes.xml`, must keep every one of:
`windowIsTranslucent` true, `windowBackground` and `colorBackground`
transparent, `windowNoTitle` true, `windowContentOverlay` null,
`backgroundDimEnabled` false, `windowDisablePreview` true (this is
the one that stops the starting-window snapshot flash), and
`windowAnimationStyle` null. `AndroidManifest.xml` must set this
theme on `FaceKeeperActivity`.

In `FaceKeeperActivity.kt`, `onCreate()` and `onResume()` must call
`finish()` plus `overridePendingTransition(0, 0)` when
`FaceHandoffState.isChromeHandoff()` is false.
`FaceKeeperActivity` must never call `setChromeHandoff(true)` itself;
only `MainActivity`, PiP, or the Chrome flow sets that. `FaceKeeper`'s
own `acquire()` and `release()` must add
`Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION`, and the caller must call
`overridePendingTransition(0, 0)` after `startActivity()`.

`recordRelayPostSuccess()` fires only on a successful HTTP ingest in
`FaceHttpRelay`, never on a handoff toggle. A cold launcher start
(`ACTION_MAIN`, `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`, no saved state) must call
`clearChromeHandoff()`. `canRestoreHandoffSession(inPiP,
pausingForChrome)` gates the keeper restore; it returns true only
when a handoff is active and the app is in PiP or transitioning to
Chrome.

## What is already implemented

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Gradle app, WebView shell, dev HTTPS (debug SSL proceed) | Done |
| `XrFaceTrackingEngine`, Jetpack `Session`, `Face.getUserFace`, roughly 30 Hz | Done |
| `FaceHttpRelay`, an OkHttp POST to `/__native_face_ingest` | Done |
| `FaceBridgeForegroundService` plus notification | Done |
| `FaceKeeper`/`FaceKeeperActivity`, a transparent 1x1 host during the Chrome handoff | Done |
| `FaceHandoffState`, `SharedPreferences` for `chromeHandoff`, a 30-second stale threshold | Done |
| `FaceTrackingCoordinator`, Jetpack plus OpenXR, picks the freshest `lastPostAgeMs()` | Done |
| OpenXR native (`libcs_openxr_face.so`, `OpenXrFaceEngine`, GLES/PBuffer Phase 1b) | Scaffolded, partial |
| Permissions: `FACE_TRACKING`, notifications, camera, audio for WebView | Done |
| Web side: `nativeFaceBridge.js`, `nativeFaceRelay.js`, a Vite plugin, tests | Done |

### Payload contract, the JSON POST body

Preferred: WebXR-style keys, `{ "weights": { "jaw_drop": 0.6, ... },
"t": <epochMs> }`. Or a dense array: `{ "openxrParameters": [68
floats], "t": ... }`, in the Khronos
`XrFaceParameterIndicesANDROID` order. The web side maps this
through `src/library/openxrFaceParameterMap.js` into
`applyExpressionWeightRecordToVRMS`, in
`src/library/xrExpressionTrackingDriver.js`. RFD 1060 gives the full
spec.

## Status after a May 2026 rebuild (verify on device)

| Mode | Behavior before the fix | Expected after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flat Chrome or WebView | Works: `nativeKeys` 25, 42 | Unchanged |
| Chrome immersive AR (Full Space) | Relay stale, `nativeKeys=0`, Jetpack `not TRACKING` | The OpenXR PBuffer path plus `FaceKeeperActivity` host; Jetpack as fallback |

### Implemented that same pass

1. Headless OpenXR (Phase 1b): `openxr_face_engine.cpp` prefers PBuffer EGL; `OpenXrFaceEngine.tryStartNative` needs no `TextureView` or `surfaceReady`.
2. Chrome handoff: `FaceKeeperActivity.onResume` calls `setActivity`, `setSessionHost`, `ensureFacePipeline("keeper-onResume")`.
3. Coordinator: `OpenXrFaceEngine.ensureFacePipeline` always runs; Jetpack also runs when `!OpenXrFaceEngine.isCollecting()` or `chromeHandoff`.
4. Watchdog and recycle: `CHROME_HANDOFF_STALE_MS` is 10 seconds. A forced recycle happens when the relay stays quiet twice that threshold (roughly 20 seconds), even if the collector still ticks; `COLLECTOR_STUCK_CHROME_MS` is 20 seconds.
5. Foreground service type: `dataSync|camera|microphone` (the microphone type gated to API 34+); the manifest declares `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE`.
6. Handoff expiry: a restored handoff only applies if the last successful relay ingest was under 60 seconds ago. A cold launcher start clears the handoff; `FaceKeeperActivity` finishes if the handoff flag is false.

### Known gaps, not fully fixed

| Issue | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Web-versus-APK stale mismatch | The web side holds the last weights for 30 seconds while `xrPresenting`; the APK's own handoff staleness is 10 seconds, intentionally, trading UI stability against faster recovery. |
| Jetpack and OpenXR running in parallel during handoff | The coordinator can still start Jetpack while `chromeHandoff` is set, even when OpenXR is already collecting, which can compete for GLES on Galaxy XR; watch logcat for session failures. |
| The foreground-service `microphone` type | Declared only for process priority; face tracking itself does not use the microphone. Add it only if the WebView/foreground path actually records audio, or a store policy may question it. |
| A prior assistant summary's typo | It claimed "1.5x stale = 15s"; the code actually uses 2x `effectiveStaleMs()`, roughly 20 seconds, during handoff. |
| `OpenXrFaceEngine.kt` | `setSurface` still only nudges the pipeline when `surfaceReady`; the headless path runs through `ensureFacePipeline` with no surface, which is correct. |

### Success criteria, on a re-test after rebuild

In Chrome AR: `nativeKeys > 25`, `relay=poll+sse/<500ms`, sustained
while `xrPresenting=true` (live ingest, not a frozen cache). Logcat
shows `ON-OpenXrFace` "OpenXR GLES face started" or "First OpenXR
face push", or `ON-JetpackFace` "TRACKING" plus `ON-FaceHttpRelay`
posts.

## Key files to open first

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `MainActivity.kt` | WebView, permissions, the Chrome-handoff menu item, picture-in-picture, FaceKeeper get/release |
| `XrFaceTrackingEngine.kt` | The Jetpack face-collect loop, `FaceHttpRelay.post`, watchdog and recycle logic |
| `FaceKeeper.kt` / `FaceKeeperActivity.kt` | The session host while Chrome runs in XR |
| `FaceHandoffState.kt` | The persistent Chrome-handoff flag |
| `FaceBridgeForegroundService.kt` | The foreground service, keeper restart, reconfigure on a stale relay |
| `FaceTrackingCoordinator.kt` | Starts and stops Jetpack plus OpenXR |
| `FaceHttpRelay.kt` | The LAN POST to the dev server |
| `OpenXrFaceEngine.kt` plus `app/src/main/cpp/*` | OpenXR 1.0.x, `XR_ANDROID_face_tracking`, the GLES binding |
| `FaceBlendShapeMaps.kt` | The Jetpack-to-WebXR key mapping |
| `AndroidXrBridgeInterface.kt` | The JS-facing `AndroidXRBridge.onBridgeReady()` |

Log tags: `ON-JetpackFace`, `ON-FaceKeeper`, `ON-FaceBridgeSvc`,
`ON-FaceHttpRelay`, `ON-OpenXrNative`, `ON-XR-WebView`.

## Platform constraints, do not violate

1. WebView is not WebXR; never attempt immersive XR inside WebView. Chrome only, for AR or VR.
2. The Galaxy XR OpenXR runtime accepts API 1.0.x only (1.1 is rejected: "Max supported version is 1.0.34").
3. `android.permission.FACE_TRACKING` is required before `xrCreateFaceTrackerANDROID`.
4. Chrome cannot share an OpenXR session with this APK; a headless, separate OpenXR instance is the intended Phase 1b approach.
5. The dev URL comes from `local.properties`: `weftspun3dStudio.url=https://<PC_LAN_IP>:3000/` (the legacy alias `characterStudio.url` still works). The PC runs `npm run dev --host`, and the firewall allows TCP 3000.
6. HTTPS: debug builds trust dev certificates for the relay POST; a release build must never blindly `proceed()` on an SSL error.

## Follow-up tasks, if Full Space AR still fails

1. Verify OpenXR actually posts in AR: check logcat's `ON-OpenXrFace` tag, or a remote-log `faceSrc=openxr` / payload `"source":"openxr"`.
2. Reduce Jetpack/OpenXR contention: consider running Jetpack only when `!OpenXrFaceEngine.isCollecting()` during handoff (today, Jetpack always runs on handoff).
3. Confirm the `FACE_TRACKING` runtime permission is granted before `xrCreateFaceTrackerANDROID` runs.
4. If a future Google release documents face data reaching Chrome WebXR without a relay, prefer that path for production.

Do not remove the HTTP relay without a Chrome replacement ready. Do
not break WebView's `evaluateJavascript` path. Never commit a secret
or a LAN IP into source.

## How to test

1. On the PC: `npm run dev`, then open `https://<PC_IP>:3000/?remoteLog=1&nativeFaceRelay=1`.
2. Install the debug APK; grant face, notification, and camera permissions.
3. Open the app, load the site, then the menu's "Open in Chrome for WebXR (+ face)".
4. Keep the Weftspun XR Face app visible, or its picture-in-picture bubble, in Home Space.
5. Enter AR in Chrome; watch the PC's `logs/remote-log.txt` for `[ON-NATIVE-FACE-DIAG] nativeKeys=… relay=… xrPresenting=…`.
6. Use `adb logcat` with the tags above, or this repository's own `scripts/capture-apk-logcat.ps1`.

| RFD 1069 | WebXR expression notes, remote logging |

## One-sentence summary

Keep Jetpack XR, and optionally OpenXR's `XR_ANDROID_face_tracking`,
posting roughly 30 Hz of face blend shapes to a LAN HTTP relay while
Chrome runs Full Space WebXR, because Chrome does not expose
`expression-tracking` and WebView cannot run WebXR at all.
